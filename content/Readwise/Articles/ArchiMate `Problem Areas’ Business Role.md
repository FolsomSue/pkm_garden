## Highlights
- The Business Function (or process) uses the application and to model that the application is also the one performing the business function, a kind of short cut  Assigned-To relation is drawn between Application Component and Business Function (or process). But we now have a business layer where we do have behaviour, but *no role to perform it*. That does not seem right. And the application component also sort of uses itself, which also sandpapers my ‘modeling nerves’. Besides, in ArchiMate there are two relation types that can go from layer to layer in a natural way: Realization and Used-By. It would in my opinion be cleaner if Assigned-To would be internal to a layer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vbn7758stwjavrhr322mtc))
