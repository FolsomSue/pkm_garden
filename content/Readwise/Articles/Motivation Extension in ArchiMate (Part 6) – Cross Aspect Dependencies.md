  Motivation Extension in ArchiMate (Part 6) – Cross Aspect Dependencies
  The purpose of the motivation extension is to model the motivation behind the core elements in some enterprise architecture. Therefore, it should be possible to relate motivational elements to core elements as shown in Figure below:

  Meaning and value can be associated with any structure or behavior element.
  **Relating Core Elements with Requirement Diectly**
  A requirement can be related directly to a structure or behavior element by means of a realization relationship. Also, the weaker influence relationship is allowed between these elements

  The Figure above depicts the relationship between concepts from the Implementation and Migration extension and concepts from the ArchiMate core and Motivation extension as follows:
  • A deliverable may realize core elements within an architecture.
  • A gap may be associated with any number of core elements.
  • A location may be assigned to work packages and deliverables.
  • A work package realizes requirements indirectly through the realization of core elements (e.g., an application component, business process, or service).
  • Core elements are linked to the other concepts of the Motivation extension by means of derived relationships as shown in the Figure below

  **Relating Core Element with Value and Meaning Indirectly**
  Other motivational elements cannot be related directly to a structure or behavior element, but only indirectly by means of derived relationships via Value or Meaning.
