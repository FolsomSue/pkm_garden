  Definitions
  **Architecture** is structure of components, their inter-relationships and principles & guidelines governing their design and evolution over time is architecture
  An **Enterprise** is Any group of Organization’s working towards a shared goal. It could be a business OR multiple businesses working together
  **Enterprise Architecture** is a structured approach to organize and manage information technology assets and processes in alignment with overall Business Strategy
  **Architecture Principles** are general rules and guidelines, intended to be enduring and seldom amended, that inform and support the way in which an organization sets about fulfilling its mission
  **Architecture Requirements Specification** is a set of quantitative statements that outline what an implementation project must do in order to comply with the architecture.
  **Request For Architecture Work** is a document that is sent from the sponsoring organization to the architecture organization to trigger the start of an architecture development cycle
  **Statement of Architecture Work** is the scope and approach that will be used to complete an architecture development cycle
  **Architecture Contract** is a joint agreement between development partner and sponsors on deliverable quality of an architecture
  Individual with an interest in System is **Stakeholder**
  **Architecture Repository** is structured way to store all important document, artifacts and information related to organization’s architecture
  **Content Framework** is framework to be used to structure architecture description, which is also the document showing architecture and different models explaining architecture
  **Architecture Capability** is ability to develop , use and sustain architecture of particular enterprise and use architecture to govern changes
  **Risk Analysis** is effect of un-certainty on objectives. The effect of un-certainty is any deviation from what is expected
  **GAP Analysis** is a technique to highlight shortfall between Baseline and Target Architectures
  **ADM** (Architecture Development Method) is tested and repeatable process fir developing architectures. It’s a method for deriving organization specific enterprise architecture and is specially designed to address business requirements
  Documents which are under development and have not yet undergone formal review and approval process is **Draft**
  **Architecture View** is representation of system from perspective of related set of concerns
  **Architecture Viewpoint** is specification of convention for constructing and using architecture Views
  **ADM** (*Architecture Development Cycle*)

  Architecture Development Method cycle
  Purpose of ADM
  *Preliminary Phase* : 
  Initial steps and preparations needed to establish an Architecture Capability. It includes the customization of the TOGAF framework to suit specific organizational needs and the creation of Architecture Principles.
  *Phase A: Architecture Vision* 
  Early stage of an architecture development cycle, detailing the definition of scope, identification of stakeholders, creation of the Architecture Vision, and securing approval to advance with the architecture development.
  *Phase B: Business Architecture 
  Phase C: Information Systems Architectures(Data and Application) 
  Phase D: Technology Architecture* 
  Describes the development of four architectures, that are commonly accepted as subsets of an overall Enterprise Architecture, to support the agreed Architecture Vision: 
  — Business 
  — Information Systems — Data 
  — Information Systems — Application 
  — Technology
  *Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions* 
  Involves initial planning for implementation and identifying delivery mechanisms for the architecture defined in earlier phases.
  *Phase F: Migration Planning* 
  Focuses on transitioning from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by completing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan.
  *Phase G: Implementation Governance* 
  Provides architectural oversight for the implementation.
  *Phase H: Architecture Change Management* 
  Establishes procedures for managing change to the new architecture.
  *Requirements Management* 
  Operates the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM. 
  This is a continuous phase which ensures that any changes to requirements are handled through appropriate governance processes and reflected in all other phases.
  ADM Phase-wise Objectives
  *Preliminary Phase* 
  • Determine the Architecture Capability desired by the organization. 
  • Establish the Architecture Capability.
  *Phase A: Architecture Vision* 
  • Develop a high-level aspirational vision of the capabilities and business value to be delivered as a result of the proposed Enterprise Architecture 
  • Obtain approval for a Statement of Architecture Work that defines a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in the Architecture Vision
  *Phase B: Business Architecture* 
  • Develop the Target Business Architecture that describes how the enterprise needs to operate to achieve the business goals, and respond to the strategic drivers set out in the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses the Statement of Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns 
  • Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Business Architectures
  *Phase C: Data Architecture* 
  • Develop the Target Data Architecture that enables the Business Architecture and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses the Statement of Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns 
  • Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Data Architectures
  *Phase C: Application Architecture* 
  • Develop the Target Application Architecture that enables theBusiness Architecture and the Architecture Vision, in a way that addresses the Statement of Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns 
  • Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Application Architectures
  *Phase D: Technology Architecture* 
  • Develop the Target Technology Architecture that enables the Architecture Vision, target business, data, and application building blocks to be delivered through technology components and technology services, in a way that addresses the Statement of Architecture Work and stakeholder concerns 
  • Identify candidate Architecture Roadmap components based upon gaps between the Baseline and Target Technology Architectures
  *Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions* 
  • Generate the initial complete version of the Architecture Roadmap, based upon the gap analysis and candidate Architecture Roadmap components from Phases B, C and D 
  • Determine whether an incremental approach is required, and if so identify Transition Architectures that will deliver continuous business value 
  • Define the overall Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) to finalize the Target Architecture based on the ABBs
  *Phase F: Migration Planning* 
  • Finalize the Architecture Roadmap and the supporting Implementation and Migration Plan 
  • Ensure that the Implementation and Migration Plan is coordinated with the enterprise’s approach to managing and implementing change in the enterprise’s overall change portfolio 
  • Ensure that the business value and cost of work packages and Transition Architectures is understood by key stakeholders
  *Phase G: Implementation Governance* 
  • Ensure conformance with the Target Architecture by Implementation Projects 
  • Perform appropriate Architecture Governance functions for the solution and any implementation-driven architecture Change Requests
  *Phase H: Architecture Change Management* 
  • Ensure that the architecture development cycle is maintained 
  • Ensure tha ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdqap8hjrwe6d9hbss3713q4))
