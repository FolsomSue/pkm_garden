Hi all

Just set up my purple yesterday, in router mode, between my ISP modem and my Netgear AX8 RAX70 (in AP mode, as suggested). All works well, except my Synology NAS which has a wired connection to the NetGear seems to be unreachable on the resultant network. It shows up on FWP as a device but always states it's offline (it's been reset and powered up just fine) with no IP; the Netgear still shows it connected to it with it's original IP. But nothing on the home network can see it, including Synology's own Synology Assistant which scans networks for NAS devices.

Since I can't see the NAS on any network device (no IP on the FWP network) I can't log in, see if there are log files to diagnoses, etc. etc. And everything was up to date and performing properly before I added the FWP.

Any idea if what I'm trying to do is even possible? Can a wired connection on the NetGear in AP mode be made visible via the FWP network? Should I be going with Bridge mode rather than AP?

Strangely, I have a Helm email device also wired into the NetGear, and it shows up on the FWP just fine. Weird, so that probably answers that whole "wired in AP mode" thing.

Any ideas? I've done some web searching and I haven't seen this scenario mentioned as such.

Thanks in advance for any insights!
