**_Enterprise content management (ECM) software is defined as a platform that enables an enterprise-scale organization to intelligently store, organize, and retrieve the organization’s content._** 

Our reliance on content is rapidly growing. From websites to push your marketing footprint to internal knowledge repositories that inform product development, digitalization has made it easier to generate content than ever before. However, many companies face a challenge when trying to [manage their content repositories](https://www.spiceworks.com/collaboration/content-collaboration/articles/best-content-management-system-features/ "manage their content repositories") in a coherent and efficient manner.

To solve this problem, businesses are turning to enterprise content management (ECM) software. An ECM software comprises platforms that consolidate all the activities needed to manage content under one roof.

## What Is Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Software? 

[Enterprise content management](https://www.spiceworks.com/collaboration/content-collaboration/articles/what-is-enterprise-content-management/ "Enterprise content management") (ECM) software is a platform that enables an enterprise-scale organization to intelligently store, organize, and retrieve the organization’s content.

According to a 2020 Markets and Markets report, options for both buyers and sellers for ECM software are increasing and are expected to grow to a $67 Billion+ market by 2025, a nearly 50% growth in 5 years. This may further accelerate as the COVID-19 shutdown forces more and more companies to switch to remote employment, boosting the demand for an online ECM even more.

## Key Must-Have Features of ECM Solutions 

Before choosing an ECM solution, it is a must to check if it offers the key must-have features. Here is a list of features businesses must consider before finalizing a product.

**10 Features an ECM Software Should Have**

### 1\. Robust document and asset management

One of the core features that an ECM must provide is a robust and sophisticated [document and asset management system](https://www.spiceworks.com/collaboration/digital-asset-management/articles/top-10-document-management-systems/ "document and asset management system") with customizable folders and access verification. This includes storing any type of content and assets intended for internal or external (customer) communication- articles, marketing PDFs, employee training documents and materials, sales pitches, proposals, templates, etc.

### 2\. Secure collaboration 

Collaboration should be a key offering for your ECM; especially with employees across the world working from home during the COVID-19 lockdown, the demand for collaborative features on ECM is high. Collaboration features enable multiple users across multiple departments (if needed) to work on the same document in parallel. It also allows managers to view live progress in content generation. However, with increased accessibility comes the need for increased security and user authentication. An ECM must include robust user [access level verification](https://www.spiceworks.com/it-security/identity-access-management/articles/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/ "access level verification"), and only authorized users must be allowed to view, modify, or delete documents. 

### 3\. Record management

Your enterprise content management software will be your centralized [document management](https://www.spiceworks.com/collaboration/digital-asset-management/articles/top-10-document-management-systems/ "document management") center – including your internal records for the company and departments. This includes sales reports, accounting, and customer records (CRM integration is recommended), budget and spending, etc.

### 4\. Advanced search 

With your entire organization’s content in one centralized software, it is critical that the ECM offers an advanced and fast search feature to ensure that your team can quickly access the correct documents based on search fields. These fields include looking for documents by departments and internal classifications, title, words used in the content, date, etc. ECMs that do not offer fast and accurate search results should not make it to your shortlist.

### 5\. Modification history tracking and rollback

With multiple users accessing and editing organizational files, it is important that your ECM has real-time tracking and storing of edit history – who is making the changes and when. The ECM should subsequently also have the option to roll back a document to an earlier version if an incorrect edit has been made. 

### 6\. Auto-redundancy detection

One of the key uses of an ECM comes from its ability to preserve unique and the latest copy of documents. This is made possible through the auto-detection of redundant files and presenting them for deletion. This ensures that your employees only see a single up-to-date file on a subject and do not get confused with multiple versions. 

### 7\. Integration with existing apps

Enterprise content management integration is essential if you are to build a centralized operational landscape. Your ECM software needs to offer API integration options with your existing department/role-specific systems. Through this integration, you can ensure that you have the most sophisticated and complete repository of organizational content and records, ready for [authorized access](https://www.spiceworks.com/security/identity-access-management/articles/what-is-privileged-access-management/ "authorized access"). For instance, your website, vendor management portal, and human resources information systems (HRIS) might feed into the ECM software.

### 8\. Compliance

A good enterprise content management system will follow all relevant regional and industry-specific regulations from the get-go. For example, content retiring and retrieval mechanisms will be GDPR-compliant, keeping records of user consent for every asset. Further, it will also support company-specific archival policies via advanced customizations.

### 9\. A hybrid hosting environment

You can choose to host your content and ECM processes on the public cloud, a private server (remote), or on-premise. And it is ideal to have the flexibility to choose your best-fit combination. Hybrid hosting lets you select an environment that is in sync with your industry needs. For example, a contact center with a large distributed workforce might require a [cloud-first infrastructure](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/cloud/articles/what-is-multicloud-infrastructure/ "cloud-first infrastructure") for easy access across the world, while a bank might want to store all content on-premise for security.

### 10\. Sophisticated analytics

The combination of analytics and traditional ECM gives you intelligent information management (IIM), which the Association of Information and Image Management calls the next bend in ECM software evolution. This feature takes content management a step further, adding to [data handling capabilities](https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/big-data/articles/what-is-enterprise-data-management-edm-definition-importance-and-best-practices/ "data handling capabilities").
