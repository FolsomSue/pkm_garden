# nvUltra - Searchable, portable, MultiMarkdown notes
nvUltra is an upcoming note-taking app from Brett Terpstra and Fletcher Penney. It's currently in private beta, but you can sign up below for updates as development finishes up.

### Create

Just start typing to create a new note. Drag and drop connections between notes, include images, and use [[MultiMarkdown]] to provide portable formatting.

### Search

Your notes are never far away, no matter how long ago you wrote them. Use blazing fast, full-text search to easily find the note you're looking for.

### Rest Easy

Plain Text is a universal format, and flat files are ready to travel. Your notes are future-proof, portable, and never locked in.

### Modal Entry

It's easiest to take notes and jot down ideas when you don't have to think about where to put them. Create new notes and search existing ones with blazing fast accuracy, all from the same place. Just start typing!

### Portable Notes

nvUltra uses plain text (MultiMarkdown) files for all of your notes. They're always yours, never locked in a database or a proprietary format. Edit them with any other application, even while you're using nvUltra. We'll keep up!

### Unlimited Notebooks

Any folder on your Mac can be a notebook, and you can start a new one any time. You can have as many notebooks as you need. One for work, one for play, one for every project. Open multiple notebooks at once, drag and drop between them, and use the Folder Navigator to quickly return to any folder you've ever opened in nvUltra. You can even use nested folders for organization within a notebook.

### Not Just Text

Your notebooks can include any kind of file. Images, TaskPaper files, OPML documents… whatever you need. All filetypes are indexed by name and can be dragged into text notes as links or images, and some filetypes (such as PDF) are fully indexed for search.

### (Multi)Markdown

With the Markdown editing capabilities of [MultiMarkdown Composer](https://multimarkdown.com/ "MultiMarkdown Composer, the ultimate Markdown editor"), nvUltra has everything you need to take your Markdown notes to the next level, including a live preview. It also works great with [Marked 2](https://marked2app.com/ "Smarter Tools for Smarter Writers - Marked 2")!

And while we have our own opinions about what external apps work best, you can open any note (or other file) in any capable external editor. There's even a shortcut key to open a file in the system default for the filetype.

### Live Preview

Instantly see how your MultiMarkdown notes will format with a live side-by-side preview. There are multiple built in styles, both light and dark, and you can customize your own with a little CSS.

The editor and preview panes even have synchronized scrolling so they're always where you expect them to be, plus support for MathJax and KaTeX for equations, and Highlight.js for code highlighting.

### Change Your Look

nvUltra comes with multiple editor and preview themes, and they're completely customizable.
