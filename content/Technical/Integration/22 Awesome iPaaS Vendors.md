### [Complex B2B integrations](https://www.youredi.com/blog/why-b2b-integrations)

Integrations shouldn’t take forever to be deployed. With pre-built connectors and integration scenarios, we can cut the development and deployment times to minimal. You can go live with your first connections in days!

### Up to 70% Savings 

Once you saved time on development and deployment, there is even something better: saving on the integration costs. Some of our customers have seen [up to 70% cost savings](https://www.youredi.com/blog/ipaas-pricing-made-easy).

### Too much to choose from?

This is a long list of vendors – and there is more. We suggest that you pro-actively become familiar with all the relevant ones for you, initiate a discussion with them and evaluate how they [comply with your data integration strategy](https://www.youredi.com/blog/5-ways-ipaas-supports-your-data-integration-strategy).
