# Publish to OIC
Create an integration in which you add a trigger adapter to publish messages to Oracle Integration through a predefined Oracle Integration Messaging invoke. No configuration of the invoke subscriber is required.

The publisher and subscribers participating in this integration style can be activated and deactivated independently of each other.
