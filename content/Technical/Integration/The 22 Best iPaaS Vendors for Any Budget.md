#iPaaS
#Technology 
As your business grows and evolves, you'll inevitably find yourself adding more applications to your [tech stack](https://blog.hubspot.com/customers/auditing-your-companys-tech-stack-or-platform-apps?_ga=2.3211577.804219306.1629403578-722484826.1629403578). If those applications run on different platforms and can't communicate effectively, you're going to run into issues with data loss, duplication of efforts, and bottlenecks that slow your team down.

If you've decided you want to invest in an iPaaS tool but aren't sure where to start, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll go over some of the best iPaaS vendors, so you can discover one that fits your company's unique needs and budget. Let's dive in.

[![Unlock tips, systems & recommended resources to stay ahead of the tech curve.](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/53/9250c9ad-08a1-4f8c-8bc5-08b250052eb3.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/9250c9ad-08a1-4f8c-8bc5-08b250052eb3)

## iPaaS Vendors: Top Features to Look For

[iPaaS](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ipaas-guide) — which stands for Integration Platform as a Service — helps you connect the tools and systems that power your business in one place, so information can be shared without high-maintenance, one-off integrations, or manual data entry.

When considering iPaaS vendors and companies, you should know what to look for to get the most out of your investment. While some solutions are free, others can come with a hefty price tag.

Here are the top features you should look for.

### User-Friendly Workflows Tool

iPaaS solutions allow you to integrate two or more apps to automate a process that otherwise takes longer to complete. It’s a critical tool to have in your [workflow automation](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/workflow-automation) arsenal. As such, it should allow you to build workflows and connect apps in a user-friendly, no-code workflows tool.

The exception would be if you’re planning to create highly personalized workflows and integrations using code.

### API Management Tool

You may be looking for an iPaaS provider that can help you build and deploy an [API](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/application-programming-interface-api). You may also wish to create a unique integration tool using APIs from various apps and platforms. Some iPaaS services offer an API management feature either within the platform or as an add-on.

### Templated Integrations

For small-to-medium businesses without an integration workflow, it’ll be critical to choose a tool that offers at least a few basic templated integrations to get you off the ground. Whether you want to create a simple or complicated series of integrations, the iPaaS vendor should offer a jumping-off point.

### Top-Notch Security

iPaaS vendors will be handling your company’s confidential data, so they should offer end-to-end security and encryption. Most iPaaS vendors list their certifications and describe their security measures on their websites. If you have any doubts or special concerns about the security of your data, be sure to bring up any questions during the demo or consultation.
