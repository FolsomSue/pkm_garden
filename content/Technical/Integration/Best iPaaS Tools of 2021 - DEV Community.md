With ever evolving business trends, it’s now more important than ever to keep up with the competition. Gone are the days when a single application was able to meet the demands of the customers and achieve their growth targets. Today, the fast-paced world seeks a multitasking environment, which is not possible without a combination of programs working TOGETHER to accomplish different elements of a single task. Integration is the need of the hour and iPaaS tools make sure that it is accomplished at its best.

iPaaS stands for Integration Platform as a Service. It is a tech-revolution that helps B2B SaaS companies to connect the existing tools and systems in an organization for improving the overall productivity and performance of its cloud-based applications.

Organizations use iPaaS tools to reduce the complexity and size of their day-to-day work while achieving the least possible downtime, failovers, and development time. The tools are infrastructure for connecting different platforms and deploying SaaS applications within the cloud.
