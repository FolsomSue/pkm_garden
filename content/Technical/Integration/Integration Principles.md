 #Technology #Integration #Principles 
Design as if always crossing a network boundary
	- Covers on-prem vs. cloud
	- Covers Corporate vs. OT 
		- trust zones high to low
- << Conventional Principles: >>
	- Buy vs. Build
	- Leverage Data Mapping, transformations, etc. from the iPaaS capabilities
- Session
	- Stateful vs. Stateless
	- Do not rely on source / target system implementations to leverage session states; instead explicitly exchange / reference pertinent session states
- Leverage iPaaS to Implement all patterns
	- THere may be exceptions for Legacy systems / integrations
- Authentication
	- Centralized IdAM? -> we leverage Okta for all platform / cross-platform authentication
	- OAuth 2.0, SAML-based API-key authentication
	- Separation of System authentication from User authorization (access)
- Security baked-in
	- Secure protocols
- Leverage Open Standards
- Loosely-coupled
- Leverage iPaaS wherever possible
