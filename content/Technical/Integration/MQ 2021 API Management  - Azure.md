We are excited to share that Microsoft has been named a Leader once again in the [2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-27KLXZ98&ct=211001&st=sb). Microsoft’s API management platform, [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/), helps customers scale their digital operations and create new revenue opportunities by helping build full lifecycle API programs in a secure and reliable environment.

**Comprehensive Full Lifecycle API Management platform:** APIs are a quintessential part of modern application development. They enable applications, systems, and services to effectively communicate, breaking the silos of the underlying technology. Azure API Management enables organizations to plan, design, implement, test, deploy, operate, and version their APIs in a secure, easy, and efficient manner to unlock the full potential of their data and services. With the built-in developer portal, API providers can publish APIs for discovery and consumption by internal, partner, and external developer ecosystems. API providers can run Azure API Management gateway on Kubernetes and anywhere across cloud and on-premises with Azure Arc. This offers better flexibility and control to developers to host their applications wherever they want to while providing the productivity benefits of Azure API Management.

**Enabling Digital Transformation:** Azure API Management is a core part of the digital transformation of our customers. We empower professional as well as citizen developers to use APIs to build highly scalable digital solutions. Citizen developers can use API Management integrated with Microsoft Power Apps to scale their solutions with custom connectors in Azure. They can also leverage the API-M connector for Power Automate to integrate existing systems, services, and data connected to Azure API Management and optimize repetitive processes.

**Flexible and transparent pricing:** Azure API Management offers flexible pricing options such as Consumption, Developer, Basic, Standard, Premium, and Isolated to suit every business scenario. We recently announced a 50 percent reduction in prices for all subsequent units purchased after the first unit for the API Management Premium tier to allow customers to scale and achieve resiliency more cost-effectively.

**Integrated experience with Azure Services:** Azure API Management is deeply integrated with Azure Integration Services such as Logic Apps, Event Grid, and other Azure services to offer a uniform and productive experience for our customers. Azure API Management can natively import APIs from Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Azure API Apps, providing an intuitive user experience. Azure API Management has strong integration with Azure Active Directory, providing secure identity, authentication, and access management to users. In addition, Azure API Management provides strong developer and DevOps integration, reaching out to users on the platform of their choice. API developers can configure, test, and debug APIs and policies in Azure API Management within their primary tools such as Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio and orchestrate the deployment of API Management artifacts using GitHub Actions.

**Global availability and customer momentum:** With availability across 54 Azure regions, we have a strong global customer and partner network. Azure API Management is available in 18 languages and provides documentation in more than 50 languages through the Azure portal.
