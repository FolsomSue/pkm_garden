Different Types of EDI and a Range of Approaches to Enabling EDI Across a Trading Community.

Electronic data interchange (EDI) is one of the most common forms of structured exchange of business documents between organizations by electronic means. There are many different types of EDI and a range of approaches to enabling EDI across a trading community. Whether looking at EDI for the first time or expanding an existing EDI infrastructure to support a variety of business partners across the globe, there is a method of utilizing EDI that will suit your business needs, technical capabilities and budget. Many larger companies adopt hybrid EDI solutions to connect with their business partners, dependent on size, importance and frequency of their transactions.

### Direct EDI/Point-to-Point

Brought to prominence by Walmart, direct EDI, sometimes called point-to-point EDI, establishes a single connection between two business partners. In this approach, you connect with each business partner individually.

### Mobile EDI

Users have traditionally accessed EDI by a private network such as a VAN or the Internet in order to send and receive EDI-related business documents. Mobile EDI has had limited adoption, in part due to security concerns with mobile devices across an EDI infrastructure, but mainly due to restrictions with the mobile devices available. The screen quality and size of devices has been unsuitable, but there is a growing industry developing software applications (‘apps’) for downloading onto mobile devices so it is only be a matter of time before you will be able to download supply chain and EDI related apps from private or corporate app stores.

### EDI Outsourcing

EDI Outsourcing (also referred to as B2B Managed Services and B2B Outsourcing) is a fast-growing option that enables companies to use external specialist resources to manage their EDI environment on a day-to-day basis. This is in part driven by companies wanting to integrate to back office business systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms. Many companies do not want to use their internal resources to undertake this ongoing type of work so they outsource it instead. [Read More »](https://www.edibasics.com/types-of-edi/edi-outsourcing/)
