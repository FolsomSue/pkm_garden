## Market Definition/Description

Gartner defines enterprise integration platform as a service (EiPaaS) as a combination of integration technology functionalities that are delivered as a suite of cloud services and designed to support enterprise-class integration initiatives. An EiPaaS provider offers high availability, disaster recovery, security, SLAs and technical support. It also enables users to develop and execute multiple integration scenarios by providing support for multiple personas. The EiPaaS vendor must fully manage platform operations, patching and upgrades.

EiPaaS offerings are public, stand-alone products that subscribers use directly, as opposed to integration capabilities embedded in another offering (such as a SaaS application or application PaaS).

### Vendors Added and Dropped

We review and adjust our inclusion criteria for Magic Quadrants as markets change. As a result of these adjustments, the mix of vendors in any Magic Quadrant may change over time. A vendor's appearance in a Magic Quadrant one year and not the next does not necessarily indicate that we have changed our opinion of that vendor. It may be a reflection of a change in the market and, therefore, changed evaluation criteria, or of a change of focus by that vendor.

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

To qualify for inclusion in this Magic Quadrant, vendors had to deliver a service with the following characteristics:

-   It had to be a **cloud service** that is available via subscription to all qualified subscribers and is accessible through internet technologies. This service had to include:
    
    -   Some sharing of physical resources between logically isolated tenants (subscribers or applications).
        
    -   Some self-service provisioning and management by subscribers.
        
    -   Bidirectional scaling without interruption of activities and with some automation.
        
    -   Some instrumentation for resource use tracking.
        

-   It had to be a **PaaS solution** that:
    
    -   Encapsulates the underlying virtual or physical machines, their procurement, management and direct costs, and does not require tenants to be aware of them.
        
    -   Delegates the patching, versioning and health of the platform stack to the provider.
        

-   It had to provide the following **iPaaS capabilities:**
    
    -   **Application integration features** **—** that is, the ability for different applications to exchange messages, call other business functions and automate business processes. This integration generally needs to be at the transaction level. It must support use cases such as:
        
        -   Data consistency/synchronization between applications.
            
        -   Composition of new services from aggregations of existing applications or services (typically published as APIs or events).
            
        -   Delivery of a multistep process that touches many systems.
        
    -   **D****ata consistency and sharing features —** that is, the ability for different data stores to synchronize, to move data and to combine, deduplicate and aggregate data from different stores. This integration generally involves a bulk/batch, federated/virtualized or change data capture/replication mode of data delivery. It supports requirements for extracting, transforming, combining and provisioning data to support diverse use cases (such as analytics, data management and integration).
        
    -   **B2B ecosystem integration features —** that is, the ability to enable the exchanging of data (such as payments, orders and supply chain information) electronically with business ecosystems and partners by leveraging industry-standard data formats and protocols (such as EDIFACT, X12, Swift, HL7, AS2/AS4). Executing effective B2B processes involves people from nontechnical business roles, along with trading partner onboarding and trading community management. Nontechnical users are provided access to, control over and visibility into the operation of these B2B solutions.
        
    -   **API-based integration features** **—** that is, the ability to create and integrate APIs from different sources and to manage APIs in the context of these integrations.
        
    -   **Connectivity features** to support on-premises and cloud-based endpoints, including:
        
        -   Application connectors, such as for Salesforce, Workday, NetSuite, Oracle E-Business Suite and Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, SAP S/4HANA and SuccessFactors, ServiceNow, Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Marketo.
            
        -   Data source connectors, such as for file systems and SQL and NoSQL databases.
            
        -   Technology connectors, such as for FTP, HTTP, Java Message Service (JMS) and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).
        
    -   **Features to support multiple data and message delivery styles,** including:
        
        -   API-based
            
        -   Messaging/event-based
            
        -   Batch
        
    -   **Data and message features** such as validation, mapping and transformation, and routing and orchestration.
        
    -   **End-user tools** to develop, test, deploy, execute, administer, monitor and manage integration flows, and to manage the life cycle of the relevant artifacts (transformation maps, routing rules, orchestration flows, adapter configurations and others).
        

-   It also had to target enterprise-class projects by providing:
    
    -   Support for high availability and disaster recovery.
        
    -   Secure access to endpoints and to the platform’s functionality.
        
    -   Technical support to paying subscribers.
        

-   Lastly, it had to meet the follow requirements:
    
    -   **Marketing focused on integration.** It had to be marketed as a versatile offering that can address a broad range of use cases (including application integration, data integration, B2B ecosystem and support for APIs) and industries.
        
    -   **Stand-alone offering.** It had to be provided as a stand-alone service that subscribers use directly. To use the platform, customers can subscribe to the EiPaaS capability only, not just to some other cloud service — a SaaS application or another form of PaaS, such as application platform as a service (aPaaS) — of which the iPaaS capabilities are an “embedded” subset.
        
    -   **Directly provided by the EiPaaS vendor.** The customer must be able to purchase all these capabilities directly from the vendor of the EiPaaS without engaging with third parties. The vendor must provide at least first-line support for these capabilities.
        

To qualify for inclusion, vendors had to provide all the functionality listed above as a generally available offering (as of 1 March 2021). The vendor must have had at least 900 paying customer organizations, of which at least 200 were direct customers, by the same date. We took into account the number of paying organizations, not individual users. We included both direct and indirect customers — that is, organizations that bought a provider’s EiPaaS solution via a reseller or an OEM partner.

### Quadrant Descriptions

#### Leaders

Leaders have an insightful understanding of the EiPaaS market. They have a reliable record of strong execution, an ability to influence the market’s direction and an ability to attract and keep a following. A Leader does not focus solely on current execution; rather, it plans a robust product roadmap to solidify its position and help buyers protect their investments.

Leaders continue to expand their capabilities and bring significant value to customers by addressing new types of business problems. Their platforms are cohesive and functionally rich, enabling multiple integration use cases. They often have a large global network of partners, and they regularly release updates to rapidly address emerging customer needs.

Leaders are well positioned to remain dominant as the EiPaaS market evolves. However, leadership cannot be taken for granted. In the fast-moving EiPaaS market, one misstep could have catastrophic consequences.

#### Challengers

Challengers offer mature or evolving offerings that have proven value in multiple integration scenarios. Some are vendors with a large customer base. Challengers also demonstrate the financial strength and commitment to compete aggressively in the EiPaaS market. Consequently, they offer a competitive platform (at least for certain industries and use cases).

Challengers are well positioned to succeed in this market. However, they have a somewhat limited perspective on how the market will evolve. They often have an incomplete vision of who the buyers are (and will be), what the use cases are and how users’ expectations will evolve. As a result, their offerings are more narrowly focused than those of Leaders. Challengers may lack a coordinated strategy for the various products in their platform portfolio, or their platform roadmap may be less robust than the Leaders. Alternatively, they may lag the Leaders in terms of marketing, sales channels, geographic presence, industry-specific content and innovation.

#### Visionaries

Visionaries demonstrate a strong understanding of emerging technology and business trends by aligning their EiPaaS capabilities with current demand. However, they may lack recognition or credibility beyond their customer base or particular domain. They understand the specific requirements of this market and are continuously innovating their technologies, delivery models and go-to-market strategies. Visionaries see their EiPaaS offering as a key element of a broader integration strategy. They may combine software licensing, software subscriptions and as-a-service subscriptions with EiPaaS as one of many channels for integration.

Visionaries may have a background in traditional on-premises integration middleware. As such, they have a good understanding of enterprise integration challenges. However, they may not have the sales and marketing expertise required to sell beyond their traditional IT customer base.

Visionaries may enter the EiPaaS market by acquiring another vendor, by significantly reengineering their on-premises products for cloud delivery or by developing a new technology.

#### Niche Players

Niche Players typically specialize in a vertical, geographical or functional area and only address a segment of the broader EiPaaS market. They may be startups or small companies just starting to succeed, or vendors focused on a specific subset of use cases.

However, their technology offerings and degree of customer satisfaction are often excellent. Niche Players’ offerings can be suitable for organizations that require local presence and support, want a close relationship with a provider, or seek a platform that addresses specific industry use cases or functional requirements. Niche Players that can fulfill these specific requirements may offset the viability risks associated with smaller vendors.

Niche Players potentially compete with companies from the domain-specific iPaaS market that are targeting this sector. They are also popular targets for acquisition because they offer specialized EiPaaS solutions that focus on a relatively narrow function or market segment. Their products often complement the broader integration strategies and platforms of larger vendors.

## Context

Buyers can procure most EiPaaS offerings as suites of capabilities — either in a single package or as a set of subsuites. Vendors in the EiPaaS market include pure-play providers, established software vendors for application, data and B2B integration, and megavendors. These providers build and package their EiPaaS offerings in different ways to target different use cases, personas and industries.

Leading vendors continue to extend the functionality of their EiPaaS offerings, often by merging them with their classic integration platform software technologies, acquired offerings, OEM technologies or open-source software. These providers strive to further improve EiPaaS developer productivity, reduce time to value, shorten the learning curve to ease deployments, expand their reach to potential buyers and upsell to their established customers. Leading EiPaaS vendors are also focusing their product development efforts on the use of AI, such as ML and natural language processing (NLP), to assist development and operations. These innovations will enrich packaged integration process portfolios, enable continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) and DevOps and extend the range of supported use cases (including in hybrid and multicloud scenarios).

EiPaaS is one of the essential tools that organizations are using to deliver hyperautomation (see Emerging Technologies and Trends Impact Radar: Hyperautomation), especially for business technologists who are not in IT. In our 2021 Gartner Hyperautomation Survey,1 11% of business technologists indicated enterprise integration platforms are one of the three most-used tools to support business-driven automation initiatives. Organizations are also adopting EiPaaS to accelerate digital transformation, respond to drastic business changes, contain costs and increase flexibility. As more organizations adopt cloud and SaaS applications to simplify their operations, vendor-managed solutions are becoming more appealing to buyers. We expect that buyers will increasingly prefer consumption- and service-based delivery of integration capabilities instead of classic software-based integration approaches.

## Market Overview

Organizations are continuing to adopt EiPaaS offerings as strategic alternatives to classic integration platform software. Gartner estimates that the iPaaS market generated $3.47 billion in revenue during 2020 and grew by 38.7% compared to 2019. We expect that the iPaaS market will exceed $9 billion in revenue by 2025.2

EiPaaS providers target software engineering leaders and other buyers who are looking for a strategic platform that addresses multiple business-critical integration use cases. Organizations are increasingly procuring EiPaaS solutions as a key component of their modernized integration strategy.

Despite its continued growth, the EiPaaS market is fragmented, fast-evolving and overcrowded — making it difficult for buyers to evaluate and select vendors. We expect ongoing disruption in this market as it continues to consolidate.

To navigate the EiPaaS market and to evaluate and select vendors, buyers must assess:

-   The platform’s intended goal (short-term, tactical use versus long-term strategic use).
    
-   The type and number of endpoints to connect: SaaS, packaged applications, internally developed applications, mobile apps, social media, file systems, IoT, data sources, data warehouses and data lakes.
    
-   The provider’s track record and familiarity with its industry.
    
-   The integration skills of all their user personas and how they align with the platform.
    
-   The organization’s ability to federate the EiPaaS with the established on-premises integration technology and with API management platforms.
    
-   The vendor’s SLAs and quality-of-service requirements.
    
-   The organization’s security and regulatory compliance needs.
    
-   The geographic location of the vendor’s EiPaaS data centers and support centers.
    
-   The ability to deploy the EiPaaS platform in a hybrid mode, including multicloud options across the EiPaaS public cloud and IaaS public clouds, and within the customer’s data centers.
    
-   The availability and cost of iPaaS skills from the provider and external service providers.
    
-   The long-term cost expectations and available budget.
    

Many software engineering leaders attempt to standardize on a single EiPaaS to minimize complexity and contain costs. However, they may benefit from using multiple offerings to address different use cases. Specialized EiPaaS offerings may be more suitable for LOBs and application teams working on severely time- and budget-constrained projects or for meeting specific requirements, where a purpose-built tool can drive higher productivity.

For this reason, we recommend that buyers develop a thorough understanding of their integration requirements and priorities before starting the EiPaaS selection process. In addition to the above list of considerations, they should be pragmatic and tactical by evaluating domain-specific iPaaS solutions that can deliver quick ROI.

## Evidence

1 **Gartner’s** **2021 Hyperautomation** Survey was conducted online during March 2021 among 558 business technologists from North America (n = 226), Europe (n = 146), Latin America (n = 78) and Asia/Pacific (n = 108).

To be qualified to answer the survey, respondents would need to:

-   Have created, built or coded analytics or technology capabilities on their own or with input from others in the past 12 months.
    
-   Have used at least one of the 21 tools that were considered to produce analytics or technology capabilities for work. Twenty-one tools were considered under four categories: application development tools, automation tools, integration tools, and data science and AI tools
    

Results of this study do not represent global findings or the market as a whole, but reflect sentiment of the respondents and companies surveyed.
