## What does MuleSoft do?

MuleSoft offers a suite of products that meet specific enterprise needs, including:

-   API management with MuleSoft Anypoint API Management
-   Integration with MuleSoft Anypoint Platform
-   No-code development with MuleSoft Composer

Here's a quick download on what MuleSoft does:

-   MuleSoft Anypoint works with the Mule Enterprise Service Bus and Event-driven Architecture (EDA).
-   MuleSoft uses APIs to connect applications, data, and devices, allowing associations to change and improve quickly.
-   MuleSoft Anypoint can accept requests tailored to your required data structure.
-   If you're working with Big Data, MulesSoft can help you solve problems like managing multiple data sets, productivity, expanding agility, and gaining real-time insights from your data.
-   MuleSoft integrates data from various sources, irrespective of their framework or business focus, thanks to its intuitive design and flexibility.
-   MuleSoft has many predefined APIs for a wide range of applications and systems. As a result, you gain advanced interaction with the legacy system.
-   All cloud systems have a transitional API called the System API, which modern system languages can understand and use to exchange data.

## Advantages of the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform

### **Accelerated Delivery**

MuleSoft has pre-built resources and connectors to get started quickly and speed up API development. API reusability will also increase productivity over time and promote future project success.

### **Resilient Operations**

MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform provides virtualization and analytics (e.g., geography graphs and runtime execution metrics) for making informed decisions.

### **Future-proof Foundation**

The platform adapts to change well with a sophisticated plug-and-play architectural foundation. It allows you to change requirements without needing to rebuild some APIs or integrations.

### **Automated Security**

At several stages of the API lifecycle, MuleSoft can help you conform to security and logging standards by implementing the same safety policies for all APIs. As a result, API owners can quickly design, build, and deploy secure APIs.

## Disadvantages of MuleSoft Anypoint Platform

-   Setting up agents and firewall authorizations is challenging, as it is with any system. Without networking staff, your designers may run into SSL and credential roadblocks.
-   You should expect a steep learning curve to build competency with MuleSoft. MuleSoft offers self-paced, instructor-led, and certification options through their [training site](https://training.mulesoft.com/overview). 
-   MuleSoft is pricey when compared to Red Hat and others.
-   MuleSoft fails as a processing layer due to its three-layered architecture. Also, the middle process API layers can overcomplicate things.
-   The Terms of Service have become challenging to manage, pressuring many to seek MuleSoft alternatives.
-   MuleSoft needs better documentation (and also hard to find!) and support for some B2B formats like EDI, VAN, RosettaNet, etc.
-   Smart data management and intelligent mappings are not available. As a result, leveraging AI and ML becomes a problem inside MuleSoft Anypoint, causing integration challenges.

## How should you pick an Enterprise Integration Platform?

There must be effective communication between the applications, systems, and databases that support an organization's critical business processes. To enable the smooth flow of data and transactions between the cloud and on-premises apps, you can leverage an Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) like MuleSoft.

Many integration platforms are available today, each with its advantages and disadvantages. 

### **Capabilities**

A prospective iPaaS solution should have the following features and capabilities out of the box:

-   Custom and pre-built connectors
-   Processing of large amounts of data
-   The mapping of data
-   Tools for reporting and dashboards

Before choosing an iPaaS platform, list your integration objectives and the features needed. Consider things like which connectors you'll need for your existing technology stack.

### **Security**

To keep a close watch on your data, you'll want a solution that includes features like intrusion alerts and reporting tools. In addition, your platform should adhere to industry standards, including SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA, FERPA, and HIPAA, among other important security considerations.

### **Scalability**

You shouldn't have to sacrifice performance because of integrating new applications or running usual processes handling added data and customers.

The iPaaS you select for your small business should be the iPaaS you intend to keep as your business expands. Therefore consider growth in the initial decision process. This recommendation is because it is generally challenging to migrate away from an iPaaS. Therefore, choosing wisely _once_ is preferable. 

### **Usability**

An iPaaS system must be simple to use and comprehend. Some platforms, for example, have drag-and-drop user interfaces that make projects more manageable. It's also crucial to look for pre-built connections and templates that get you up and running quickly.

### **Pricing**

Your pricing requirements are largely affected by the size of your company. You'll want to go with a solution that gives you a good return on investment while providing you with the techniques you need to succeed.

We recommend going with a platform that charges a monthly fee based on either or a combination of the following:

-   Size of your company
-   Revenue
-   Distribution of your architecture
-   Number and complexity of integrations

## MuleSoft Alternatives by Use Case

MuleSoft's one-stop shop for iPaaS, API development, and API lifecycle management. However, when it comes to supporting different use cases, other alternatives might be better than MuleSoft. To summarize:

-   Informatica is better than MuleSoft for migrating data into a data warehouse because of its data hubs and data integration specialization.
-   Boomi and Jitterbit are better at handling the B2B integrations that require EDI-based file transfers. They have many adapters for communication protocols like AS2, SFTP, etc.
-   Google's Apigee is better for creating externally-facing API products and has a customizable API developer portal.
-   IBM and TIBCO are better options for building with an event-driven architecture, which includes publishing and subscribing to different patterns and building interoperability between event streams.
-   If you need API management and iPaaS within the same vendor’s product suite, your only real alternatives are AWS, Azure, TIBCO, Boomi, SoftwareAG, SAP, and IBM.
