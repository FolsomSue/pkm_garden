#Initiative 
# Integration as a Service
## Intention
- To contract out to a third party overall integration responsibilities
	- Operational?
	- Incident management?
	- Implementation of new integrations
		- Leverage Integration Framework
## Challenge
- Unclear what the scope of the existing Kyndryl MSA is
	- This INTaaS engagement may encroach on that MSA
	- Can't get hold of the actual MSA due to restrictions
	- Have reviewed a PPT overview of Kyndryl MSA Service Delivery (by Pasco Larsen, Katherine)
## Discussion Points
- Scope / responsibility (overlap with Kyndryl MSA, for example)
- Data Integration requirements
- Prior experience with Groundswell re how well this goes...
	- Update: no major new insights
- Leverage our current iPaaS (OIC) vs. a new one required
	- OIC and Oracle MFT -- once DR-enabled -- will probably be sufficient
## Scope / Responsibility
- Configuration of new integrations / connections for both Application and Data Integration requirements
- Leveraging OIC for configuration
- Conforming to EA Standards
	- Patterns
	- Principles
	- Technologies Applicable
- Support for Integrations
	- As identified and diagnosed by existing vendor (Kyndryl)
	- RFX bidder would resolve issues identified by Kyndryl
- Bidder Technology Recommendations would be considered?
## Mulesoft Definition(s)
- Integration as a Service (sometimes abbreviated as IaaS) is a cloud service delivery model for integration. Integration-as-a-Service delivers an [integration](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/enterprise-integration-solutions) [solution](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/enterprise-integration-solutions) that provides connectivity to backend systems, sources, files, and operational applications through the implementation of well-defined interfaces, web services, and calls between applications and data sources. This provides users with a more loosely coupled environment, safe from complex interdependencies. The Integration-as-a-Service delivery model enables integration across the cloud, making it possible to share data between systems as well as third-party vendors in real-time.
- Businesses employ Integration-as-a-Service initiatives in order to gain agility and automate business processes. Moreover, with the change in the way the IT landscape is structured, businesses seek a flexible solution that is capable of delivering connectivity between databases, applications, files, and sources residing on-premises and in the cloud.
