Mule applications that run in the Anypoint Studio or Anypoint Code Builder IDEs deploy to an embedded test server in within the IDE. Because this server is not meant for production deployment and uptime restrictions apply, deploy your Mule applications using one of the deployment options supported by Anypoint Runtime Manager.

## CloudHub 2.0

CloudHub 2.0 is a fully managed, containerized integration platform as a service (iPaaS) where you can deploy APIs and integrations as lightweight containers in the cloud.

## CloudHub

CloudHub is a complete integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that provides server functionality for you to deploy your applications without having to configure a hosting environment. Based on your contract, you control how many resources to assign to your application.

You can deploy your applications from the [Anypoint Platform![Leaving the Site](https://docs.mulesoft.com/_/img/icons/external-link.svg "Leaving the Site")](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/) Runtime Manager cloud console and host them in [CloudHub](https://docs.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/). For more information on how to deploy applications to CloudHub, see [Deploy to CloudHub](https://docs.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/deploying-to-cloudhub).

## Hybrid Deployments

With the hybrid deployment option, you deploy your applications from the Runtime Manager cloud console to your Mule servers and use Runtime Manager to manage them. This option provides you with flexibility and control over your on-premises security but requires you to provide the hosting infrastructure.

To use the hybrid option, you first register your Mule servers with the Runtime Manager agent. Then, from Runtime Manager, you can optionally add those servers to server groups or clusters to provide high availability. Finally, you deploy your applications from Runtime Manager to either a server, server group, or cluster.

For more information on how to deploy applications to your Mule servers, see [Deploy to Your Servers](https://docs.mulesoft.com/deploying-to-your-own-servers).

## Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition](https://docs.mulesoft.com/private-cloud/latest/) is a containerized distribution of the management and engagement capabilities of Anypoint Platform that you host on-premises or in your organizationâ€™s private cloud environment.

If your organization has strict regulatory or compliance requirements that limit the use of cloud solutions, you can use Anypoint Platform PCE to deploy and host your applications on-premises.

For more information on how to deploy applications to Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, see [Deploy to Your Servers](https://docs.mulesoft.com/deploying-to-your-own-servers).

## Anypoint Runtime Fabric Deployments

Anypoint Runtime Fabric is a container service that automates the deployment and orchestration of Mule applications and API gateways. Runtime Fabric runs within a customer-managed infrastructure on AWS, Azure, virtual machines (VMs), and bare-metal servers.

Runtime Fabric contains all of the components it requires. These components, including Docker and Kubernetes, are optimized to work efficiently with Mule runtimes and other MuleSoft services.

To use the Runtime Fabric option, you first create a Runtime Fabric using Runtime Manager. Then, you install Runtime Fabric on your infrastructure. Finally, you deploy your applications from the Runtime Manager cloud console to the Runtime Fabric you created.

## Security for Hybrid Deployments

[![logo hybrid active](https://docs.mulesoft.com/_images/logo-hybrid-active.png "Hybrid")](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies/#hybrid-deployments)

By default, only metadata pushed by the Runtime Manager agent in each Mule runtime engine flows to the cloud. No application data is exposed.

The agent monitors and controls Mule, and publishes its data to the control plane. You can control Mule from external systems by calling Runtime Manager agent APIs, or you can specify that Mule publishes its data to external systems.

You can change the default behavior so that the agent pushes IDs, final average numbers, or any data you find useful for monitoring or keeping control of applications. See [Runtime Manager Agent](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager-agent).

[![logo hybrid active](https://docs.mulesoft.com/_images/logo-hybrid-active.png "Hybrid")](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies/#hybrid-deployments) [![logo server active](https://docs.mulesoft.com/_images/logo-server-active.png "Anypoint Platform PCE")](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies/#anypoint-platform-pce-deployments)

When deploying on-premises, you can create `Domain` mule projects with no flows and a set of global configuration elements to share among other applications deployed to the same server.

Use this strategy to avoid configuring the same settings and credentials for each application. You can also use it to configure multiple applications to listen on the same HTTP host and port, or other exclusive resources.
