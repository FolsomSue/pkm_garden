# Data Lake
A **data lake** is a system or [repository of data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_repository "Data repository") stored in its natural/raw format,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-1) usually object [blobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object "Binary large object") or files. A data lake is usually a single store of data including raw copies of source system data, sensor data, social data etc.,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-2) and transformed data used for tasks such as [reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_reporting "Data reporting"), [visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization "Data visualization"), [advanced analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analytics "Data analytics") and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning"). A data lake can include [structured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_data "Structured data") from [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database "Relational database") (rows and columns), semi-structured data ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values "Comma-separated values"), logs, [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML "XML"), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON "JSON")), [unstructured data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data "Unstructured data") (emails, documents, PDFs) and [binary data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_data "Binary data") (images, [audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_data "Audio data"), video).[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-3) A data lake can be established "on premises" (within an organization's data centers) or "in the cloud" (using cloud services from vendors such as [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company) "Amazon (company)"), [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"), or [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google")).

A **data swamp** is a deteriorated and unmanaged data lake that is either inaccessible to its intended users or is providing little value.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-4)

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_lake&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

James Dixon, then chief technology officer at [Pentaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentaho "Pentaho"), coined the term[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-woods2011-5) to contrast it with [data mart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart "Data mart"), which is a smaller repository of interesting attributes derived from raw data.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-dixon2010-6) In promoting data lakes, he argued that data marts have several inherent problems, such as [information siloing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo "Information silo"). [PricewaterhouseCoopers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers "PricewaterhouseCoopers") (PwC) said that data lakes could "put an end to data silos."[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-stein2014-7) In their study on data lakes they noted that enterprises were "starting to extract and place data for analytics into a single, Hadoop-based repository." [Hortonworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortonworks "Hortonworks"), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Cloud "Oracle Cloud"), [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft"), [Zaloni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaloni "Zaloni"), [Teradata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teradata "Teradata"), Impetus Technologies, [Cloudera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudera "Cloudera"), [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB_Inc. "MongoDB Inc."), and [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services "Amazon Web Services") now all have data lake offerings.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-8)

## Examples\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_lake&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Examples")\]

Many companies use cloud storage services such as [Google Cloud Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Storage "Google Cloud Storage") and [Amazon S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3 "Amazon S3") or a distributed file system such as [Apache Hadoop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hadoop "Apache Hadoop").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-tuulos2015-9) There is a gradual academic interest in the concept of data lakes. For example, Personal DataLake at Cardiff University is a new type of data lake which aims at managing [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big data") of individual users by providing a single point of collecting, organizing, and sharing personal data.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-10) An earlier data lake (Hadoop 1.0) had limited capabilities with its batch-oriented processing ([MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_Reduce "Map Reduce")) and was the only processing paradigm associated with it. Interacting with the data lake meant one had to have expertise in Java with map reduce and higher level tools like [Apache Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Pig "Apache Pig"), [Apache Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark "Apache Spark") and [Apache Hive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Hive "Apache Hive") (which by themselves were batch-oriented).

## Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_lake&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

In June 2015, David Needle characterized "so-called data lakes" as "one of the more controversial ways to manage [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data "Big data")".[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-needle2015-11) [PwC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers "PricewaterhouseCoopers") was also careful to note in their research that not all data lake initiatives are successful. They quote Sean Martin, CTO of [Cambridge Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Semantics "Cambridge Semantics"),

> We see customers creating big data graveyards, dumping everything into [Hadoop distributed file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop_distributed_file_system "Hadoop distributed file system") (HDFS) and hoping to do something with it down the road. But then they just lose track of what’s there.  
> The main challenge is not creating a data lake, but taking advantage of the opportunities it presents.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-stein2014-7)

They describe companies that build successful data lakes as gradually maturing their lake as they figure out which data and [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") are important to the organization. Another criticism is that the concept is fuzzy and arbitrary. It refers to any tool or data management practice that does not fit into the traditional [data warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse "Data warehouse") architecture. The data lake has been referred to as a particular technology. The data lake has been labeled as a raw data reservoir or a hub for [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load "Extract, transform, load") offload. The data lake has been defined as a central hub for self-service analytics. The concept of the data lake has been overloaded with meanings, which puts the usefulness of the term into question.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-12)

While critiques of data lakes are warranted, in many cases they are overly broad and could be applied to any technology endeavor generally and data projects specifically\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]. For example, the term “data warehouse” currently suffers from the same opaque and changing definition as a data lake. It can also be said that not all data warehouse efforts have been successful either. In response to various critiques, McKinsey noted[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake#cite_note-13) that the data lake should be viewed as a service model for delivering business value within the enterprise, not a technology outcome.
