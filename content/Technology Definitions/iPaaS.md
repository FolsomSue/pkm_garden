#iPaaS #Technology #definition 
Gartner introduced the term iPaaS in 2011, [referring to](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/information-platform-as-a-service-ipaas) _“a suite of cloud services enabling development, execution and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on premises and cloud-based processes, services, applications and data within individual or across multiple organizations”_. Since then iPaaS has been diligently serving its main purpose, which has been exactly connecting cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-on-premise applications. One can call these the most common use cases for an integration platform as a service.

iPaaS is a platform that connects otherwise disjointed systems to deliver a unified solution to customers. It acts as a conduit for communication between multiple systems, allowing for integration and data sharing. As we deepen our cloud dependency, iPaaS becomes integral to nearly every business model.

[Integration Platform as a Service](https://blogs.opentext.com/what-is-ipaas/) is a Cloud-based service that provides a platform to support applications and systems that involve a wide variety of data sources and Cloud applications as well as others such as mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT). Traditionally, on-premise integration involved point-to-point connectivity between systems. The increasing number of applications as well as Cloud services has made this approach unsustainable. Combining on-premise and Cloud iPaaS delivers everything needed to deploy, manage, govern and integrate applications and services.

This iPaaS definition sees vendors deploying a range of automated tools to develop integration flows that connect and then deploy them without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.  Common integration types for iPaaS:
