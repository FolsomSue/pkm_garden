# Managed File Transfer
## Oracle Definition
- Cloud-based
- Oracle Managed File Transfer (Oracle MFT) enables secure file exchange and management with internal departments and external partners. It protects against inadvertent access to unsecured files at every step in the end-to-end transfer of files. It is easy to use especially for non technical staff so you can leverage more resources to manage the transfer of files. The built in extensive reporting capabilities allow you to get quick status of a file transfer and resubmit it as required.
- Seems to be part of the Oracle SOA suite
