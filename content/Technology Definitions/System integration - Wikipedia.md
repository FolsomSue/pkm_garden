#Technology #definition #Integration 

**System integration** is defined in [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering") as the process of bringing together the component sub-[systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System") into one system (an aggregation of subsystems cooperating so that the system is able to deliver the overarching functionality) and ensuring that the subsystems function together as a system,<sup id="cite_ref-Heat_1-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Heat-1">[1]</a></sup> and in [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology")<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> as the process of linking together different [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing "Computing") systems and [software applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_application "Software application") physically or functionally,<sup id="cite_ref-SICourse_3-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-SICourse-3">[3]</a></sup> to act as a coordinated whole.

The [system integrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integrator "System integrator") [integrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration "Data integration") discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques such as [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), [enterprise application integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration "Enterprise application integration"), [business process management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management "Business process management") or manual [programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming").<sup id="cite_ref-Info_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Info-4">[4]</a></sup>

System integration involves integrating existing, often [disparate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_system "Disparate system") in such a way "that focuses on increasing value to the customer"<sup id="cite_ref-VonderembseAPost97_5-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-VonderembseAPost97-5">[5]</a></sup> (e.g., improved product quality and performance) while at the same time providing value to the company (e.g., reducing operational costs and improving response time).<sup id="cite_ref-VonderembseAPost97_5-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-VonderembseAPost97-5">[5]</a></sup> In the modern world connected by [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"), the role of system integration engineers is important: more and more systems are designed to connect, both within the system under construction and to systems that are already deployed.<sup id="cite_ref-Info2_6-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Info2-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Methods of integration\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=System_integration&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Methods of integration")\]

**[Vertical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration "Vertical integration")** (as opposed to "[horizontal integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_integration "Horizontal integration")") is the process of integrating subsystems according to their functionality by creating functional entities also referred to as [silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo "Information silo").<sup id="cite_ref-E-gov_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-E-gov-7">[7]</a></sup> The benefit of this method is that the integration is performed quickly and involves only the necessary vendors, therefore, this method is cheaper in the short term. On the other hand, cost-of-ownership can be substantially higher than seen in other methods, since in case of new or enhanced functionality, the only possible way to implement (scale the system) would be by implementing another silo. Reusing subsystems to create another functionality is not possible.<sup id="cite_ref-Integ_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Integ-8">[8]</a></sup>

**Star integration**, also known as **spaghetti integration**, is a process of systems integration where each system is interconnected to each of the remaining subsystems. When observed from the perspective of the subsystem which is being integrated, the connections are reminiscent of a star, but when the overall diagram of the system is presented, the connections look like spaghetti, hence the name of this method. The cost varies because of the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. In a case where the subsystems are exporting heterogeneous or proprietary interfaces, the integration cost can substantially rise. Time and costs needed to integrate the systems increase exponentially when adding additional subsystems. From the feature perspective, this method often seems preferable, due to the extreme flexibility of the reuse of functionality.<sup id="cite_ref-Integ_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Integ-8">[8]</a></sup>

**Horizontal integration** or **[Enterprise Service Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Service_Bus "Enterprise Service Bus")** (ESB) is an integration method in which a specialized subsystem is dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This allows cutting the number of connections (interfaces) to only one per subsystem which will connect directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface. This allows cutting the costs of integration and provides extreme flexibility. With systems integrated using this method, it is possible to completely replace one subsystem with another subsystem which provides similar functionality but exports different interfaces, all this completely transparent for the rest of the subsystems. The only action required is to implement the new interface between the ESB and the new subsystem.<sup id="cite_ref-Integ_8-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Integ-8">[8]</a></sup>

The horizontal scheme can be misleading, however, if it is thought that the cost of intermediate data transformation or the cost of shifting responsibility over business logic can be avoided.<sup id="cite_ref-Integ_8-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-Integ-8">[8]</a></sup>

**Industrial lifecycle integration** is a system integration process that considers four categories or stages of integration: initial system implementation, engineering and design, project services, and operations.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> This approach incorporates the requirements of each lifecycle stage of the industrial asset when integrating systems and subsystems. The key output is a standardized data architecture that can function throughout the life of the asset.

A **common data format** is an integration method to avoid every adapter having to [convert data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_conversion "Data conversion") to/from every other applications' formats, [Enterprise application integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_application_integration "Enterprise application integration") (EAI) systems usually stipulate an application-independent (or common) data format.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The EAI system usually provides a data transformation service as well to help convert between application-specific and common formats. This is done in two steps: the adapter converts information from the application's format to the bus' common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied on this (converting zip codes to city names, splitting/merging objects from one application into objects in the other applications, and so on).

## Challenges of integration\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=System_integration&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Challenges of integration")\]

System integration can be challenging for organizations and these challenges can diminish their overall return on investment after implementing new software solutions. Some of these challenges include lack of trust and willing to share data with other companies, unwillingness to outsource various operations to a third party, lack of clear communication and responsibilities, disagreement from partners on where functionality should reside, high cost of integration, difficulty finding good talents, [data silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_silos "Data silos"), and common [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface "Application programming interface") standards.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> These challenges result in creating hurdles that “prevent or slow down business systems integration within and among companies”.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Clear communication and simplified information exchange are key elements in building long term system integrations that can support business requirements.

## Benefits of integration\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=System_integration&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Benefits of integration")\]

On the other hand, system integration projects can be incredibly rewarding. For out-of-date, legacy systems, different forms of integration offer the ability to enable real-time data sharing. This can enable, for example, [publisher-subscriber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern "Publish–subscribe pattern") data distribution models, consolidated databases, [event-driven architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture "Event-driven architecture"), reduce manual user data entry (which can also help reduce errors), refresh or modernize the application's front-end, and offload querying and reporting from expensive operational systems to cheaper commodity systems (which can save costs, enable scalability, and free up processing power on the main operational system). Usually, an extensive [cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis "Cost–benefit analysis") is undertaken to help determine whether an integration project is worth the effort.
