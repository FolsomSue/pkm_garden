## TRM Components

Any TRM has two main components:

1.  A **taxonomy**, which defines terminology, and provides a coherent description of the components and conceptual structure of an information system
2.  An associated **TRM graphic**, which provides a visual representation of the taxonomy, as an aid to understanding

The objective of the TOGAF TRM is to provide a widely accepted core taxonomy, and an appropriate visual representation of that taxonomy. The TRM graphic is illustrated in [The TRM in Detail](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap19.html#tag_20_03) , and the taxonomy is explained in [Application Platform - Taxonomy](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap19.html#tag_20_04) .

## Remarks
- Defines Reference Model, mostly at high level
- Is a reference model pertaining to the Application [[Platform]]
