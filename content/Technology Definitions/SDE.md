**ArcSDE** (_SDE_ for _Spatial Database Engine_) is a server-software sub-system (produced and marketed by [Esri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri "Esri")) that aims to enable the usage of [Relational Database Management Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_Database_Management_System "Relational Database Management System") for spatial data. The spatial data may then be used as part of a [geodatabase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodatabase "Geodatabase").
