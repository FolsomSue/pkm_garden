## What are the different types of master data?

Master data is a single source of common data, but there are many master data types. They are often duplicated across the business and stored on disconnected, siloed systems with little agreement on standard definition. Common types of master data are:

### Product data

Rich and accurate product data helps customers make informed buying decisions. Studies show giving people better information and content boosts online sales and reduces returns. High-quality product data also facilitates accelerated vendor onboarding.

### Customer data

Accurate, timely and complete customer data improves business initiatives and streamlines processes for both B2B and B2C companies. It drives accurate segmentation and reporting, more personalized experiences, increased sales, regulatory compliance and more.

### Supplier data

Store and access all data related to your suppliers in one repository and reference it to any other data domain to achieve a 360° view of your critical data. This results in greater control, closer relationships and an improved supplier and product onboarding process.

### Location data

Location data is essential for managing your physical stores, offices, warehouses and more. Combine location data with product and supplier data to gain better insight into your data supply chain and mitigate business risks.

### Party data

Mastering party data allows you to create the relationships that are vital to gain an accurate understanding of the value of each of your records. It makes it easier to identify customers and provide better customer service.

### Reference data

Keeping reference data fields such as country, currency and conversions up-to-date is critical to making key business decisions, understanding their impact on the performance of your systems and meeting regulatory compliance.

### Asset data

Managing asset data with disparate systems across departments can drag down data quality. With all asset data linked together in a central repository you have an accurate overview of who is using what equipment, where it is stored, and when it was maintained and by whom.

In this style, the master data is managed centrally, but the data is synchronized with the source systems as needed. This approach is suitable for organizations that want to manage their master data centrally but also want to allow some autonomy in their business units.
- ### **Coexistence MDM:**

In this style, multiple MDM systems coexist within an organization, each managing specific domains of master data. This approach is suitable for organizations that have multiple lines of business that require different MDM systems.

To choose the right MDM deployment style for your organization, consider the following factors:

- ### **Business requirements:**

Identify the critical data domains that need to be managed, the business processes that require master data and the data governance policies and procedures that need to be enforced.
- ### **IT landscape:**

Understand the existing IT systems, the data sources and the data integration capabilities of your organization.
- ### **Organizational structure:**

Consider the organizational structure, the business units and the decision-making processes that need to be supported.
- ### **Data quality requirements:**

Determine the data quality standards that need to be met, and the level of data cleansing and enrichment that is required.
- ### **Compliance requirements:**

Consider any regulatory compliance requirements that need to be met and the level of data security that is required.

By evaluating these factors, you can choose the right MDM deployment style for your organization, ensuring that it meets your business needs, aligns with your IT landscape and complies with regulatory requirements.
