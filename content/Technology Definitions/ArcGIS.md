#Technology #definition 
**ArcGIS** is a family of [client software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_software "Client software"), [server software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_software "Server software"), and online [geographic information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system "Geographic information system") (GIS) services developed and maintained by [Esri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri "Esri"). ArcGIS was first released in 1999 and originally was released as [ARC/INFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcInfo "ArcInfo"), a command line based GIS system for manipulating data. ARC/INFO was later merged into ArcGIS Desktop, which was eventually superseded by [ArcGIS Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS_Pro "ArcGIS Pro") in 2015.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS#cite_note-4) ArcGIS Pro works in 2D and 3D for cartography and visualization, and includes Artificial Intelligence (AI).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcGIS#cite_note-5)

[[Esri]] also provides server side ArcGIS software for web maps, known as "ArcGIS Server".
