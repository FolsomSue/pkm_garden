# Business Continuity Plan

**Business continuity** may be defined as "the capability of an organization to continue the delivery of products or services at pre-defined acceptable levels following a disruptive incident",[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-1) and **business continuity planning** [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-3) (or **business continuity and resiliency planning**) is the process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats to a company.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-4) In addition to prevention, the goal is to enable ongoing operations before and during execution of [disaster recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery "Disaster recovery").[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-5) Business continuity is the intended outcome of proper execution of both business continuity planning and disaster recovery.

Several business [continuity standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#published_standards) have been published by various standards bodies to assist in check listing ongoing planning tasks.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-6)

An organization's resistance to failure is "the ability ... to withstand changes in its environment and still function".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-auto-7) Often called resilience, it is a capability that enables organizations to either endure environmental changes without having to permanently adapt, or the organization is forced to adapt a new way of working that better suits the new environmental conditions.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_continuity_planning#cite_note-auto-7)
