## What is GOST?

The GOST Model is a framework for goal setting to support strategy success. Very simply, GOST is your plan for what you are trying to achieve and how you are going to achieve it.

The GOST framework is fostered by Rich Horwath, founder of the Strategic Thinking Institute (2009).

## How does it work?

The GOST model includes four components: Goals, Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics. This quadrant chart displays the GOST model, comparing the varying levels of detail of each of the four elements and the requirements that each must adhere to.
