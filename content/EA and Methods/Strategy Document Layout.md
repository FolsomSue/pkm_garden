- IT Strategy is part of an organization's governance framework
- It is iterative, requiring updating at least on an annual basis, frequently aligned with budget / planning cycles
- The output of an IT Strategy execution is an IT [[Capability]]
- The objective of an IT Strategy is to provide value
- Consists of:
	- A list of strategic goals with an action plan to achieve each goal
- Aligns Business and IT capabilities rather than designing IT capabilities to support business requirements
	- Assuming that both business and IT capabilities drive each other
	- Assuming that business drives IT and not the other way around
- Alignment
	- Top: Company Vision
	- Second: IT Vision
	- Third: Strategic IT Objectives
	- Fourth: Strategic IT Initiatives
	- Fifth: IT Projects

- Key aspects:
	- Where are we now?
	- Where are we going?
