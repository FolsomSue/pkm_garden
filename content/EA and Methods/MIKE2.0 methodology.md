From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Method for an Integrated Knowledge Environment (**MIKE2.0**) is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open source") delivery methodology for [enterprise information management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_information_management "Enterprise information management") consultants. MIKE2.0 was released in December 2006 by [BearingPoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BearingPoint "BearingPoint")'s Information Management team under the leadership of [Robert Hillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Hillard_(writer)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Robert Hillard (writer) (page does not exist)"). The project used [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons "Creative Commons") [Attribution License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_licenses "Creative Commons licenses") and was implemented by [Sean McClowry](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_McClowry&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sean McClowry (page does not exist)"). The project is now run by the MIKE2.0 Governance Association,<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> a non-profit organisation based in Switzerland, with BearingPoint and Deloitte as the founding members. In March 2013 a book _Information Development Using MIKE2.0_ was published promoting it.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

## Description\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description")\]

The methodology provides a framework for [information management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_management "Information management"). It covers how information is created, accessed, presented and used in decision-making to how it is kept secure, stored and destroyed.

### Information development\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Information development")\]

While initially focused around structured data, it coined the term "information development". The MIKE2.0 approach is based on the premise that traditional software delivery has under-focused on the information management. The goal of MIKE2.0 is to create a new competency, specifically for managing information, <sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

### Integrated content repository\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Integrated content repository")\]

[![[400px-Mike2_integrated_content_repository.jpg]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mike2_integrated_content_repository.jpg)

Integrated Content Repository of MIKE2.0

MIKE2.0 introduces the concept of an integrated content repository.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

This repository is a federated hub of shared assets from the Internet and content held internally within an organization. Using this concept, organizations can create [mashups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(digital) "Mashup (digital)") to the MIKE2.0 standard and information management assets on the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"). Although they are not required to share any of their assets with the open source community, they are encouraged to contribute. The content repository architecture is based on using wiki-pages created in MIKE2.0, assets that are linked from other sites using a social bookmarking tools and common tagging and extensions that allows users to create mashups into their organization.

### Open methodology framework\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Open methodology framework")\]

MIKE2.0 claimed to be a pilot project for a "framework".<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> It proposes to be an approach which sits between a completely open Wikipedia-style model and a more rigorous development approach seen with software development. The collaborative technology, the structure of the content model and a number of content governance articles are used to enable this concept. The methodology states that this model is likely to evolve over time .<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIKE2.0_methodology#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

## Content model\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Content model")\]

[![[400px-Mike2_content_model.jpg]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mike2_content_model.jpg)

MIKE2.0 Content Model

MIKE2.0 is made up of building blocks, given in a block diagram.

### Products\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Products")\]

Products tend to focus on a certain type of problem as opposed to being generalized for information management like the overall implementation guide.

### SAFE Architecture\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: SAFE Architecture")\]

[![[400px-Mike2_safe_architecture.jpg]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mike2_safe_architecture.jpg)

[[SAFE Methodology]] Architecture for enterprise information management

The approach of the MIKE2 Methodology is to drive implementation of information management projects through a conceptual architecture framework known as strategic architecture for the federated enterprise (SAFE). SAFE goes across applications, data, and infrastructure and is designed to accommodate the inherent complexities of a highly federated organisation. Using a Conceptual Architecture helps align projects to a target vision for the future and to take the complexity out of the myriad of vendor choices around integration and information management.

### Information governance\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Information governance")\]

Information governance is a term used in MIKE2.0. The governance model provides assessment tools, information standards, organizational structures and roles and responsibilities in relation to managing information assets. Governance 2.0 is another term used, along with Enterprise 2.0 techniques and technologies.

#### Overall task list\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Overall task list")\]

-   **Overview and Key Concepts** frame the overall approach as well as the rationale for why MIKE2.0 was created.
-   The _overall task list_ is a project management and project implementation methodology consisting of five phases, activities for each phase, tasks for each activity and inputs/outputs for each task. These are:

-   _Phase 1_ – Business Assessment and Strategy Definition Blueprint
-   _Phase 2_ – Technology Assessment and Selection Blueprint
-   _Phase 3_ – Information Management Roadmap and Foundation Activities
-   _Phase 4_ – Design Increment
-   _Phase 5_ – Incremental Development, Testing, Deployment and Improvement

The task list is underpinned by the information development approach and tightly integrated with SAFE architecture.

-   **Usage Models** show how the different tasks are applied for different solutions. Usage models use an indicator approach to show the relevance of an activity.

#### Supporting assets\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Supporting assets")\]

_Supporting assets_ complement the overall methodology with:

-   Tools and technique papers
-   Deliverable templates
-   Capability statements
-   Software assets
-   Other tools and guides

Supporting Assets are typically the lowest-level assets of the overall approach.

## Collaboration environment\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MIKE2.0_methodology&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Collaboration environment")\]

[![[400px-Mike2_main_page.jpg]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mike2_main_page.jpg)

The MIKE2.0 Methodology

The MIKE2.0 collaboration environment is provided through omCollab, an open source collaboration product that provides the following capabilities:

-   A [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki") to collaboratively create and share content (based on the same [MediaWiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "MediaWiki") software that powers [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia "Wikipedia"))
-   [Blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogs "Blogs") to publish individual or group-based information (based on [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress "WordPress"))
