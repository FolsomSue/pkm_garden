# MoSCoW Method
![[MoSCoW Method.png]]
The **MoSCoW method** is a prioritization technique used in management, [business analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_analysis "Business analysis"), [project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management "Project management"), and [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") to reach a common understanding with [stakeholders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder "Project stakeholder") on the importance they place on the delivery of each [requirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis "Requirements analysis"); it is also known as _MoSCoW prioritization_ or _MoSCoW analysis_.

The term _MOSCOW_ itself is an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") derived from the first letter of each of four prioritization categories: M - _Must have_, S - _Should have_, C - _Could have_, W - _Won’t have_.

The interstitial _O_s are added to make the word pronounceable. While the _O_s are usually in lower-case to indicate that they do not stand for anything, the all-capitals _MOSCOW_ is also used.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="Does the original source describe MoSCoW vs MOSCOW? (July 2021)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

## Background\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MoSCoW_method&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")\]

This prioritization method was developed by Dai Clegg<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> in 1994 for use in [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development "Rapid application development") (RAD). It was first used extensively with the [dynamic systems development method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_systems_development_method "Dynamic systems development method") (DSDM) <sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> from 2002.

MoSCoW is often used with [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing "Timeboxing"), where a deadline is fixed so that the focus must be on the most important requirements, and is commonly used in [agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development "Agile software development") approaches such as [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development) "Scrum (software development)"), [rapid application development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development "Rapid application development") (RAD), and [DSDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_systems_development_method "Dynamic systems development method").

## Prioritization of requirements\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MoSCoW_method&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Prioritization of requirements")\]

All requirements are important, however to deliver the greatest and most immediate business benefits early the requirements must be prioritized. Developers will initially try to deliver all the _Must have_, _Should have_ and _Could have_ requirements but the _Should_ and _Could_ requirements will be the first to be removed if the delivery timescale looks threatened.

The plain English meaning of the prioritization categories has value in getting customers to better understand the impact of setting a priority, compared to alternatives like _High_, _Medium_ and _Low_.

The categories are typically understood as:<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

### Must have

Requirements labelled as _Must have_ are critical to the current delivery timebox in order for it to be a success. If even one _Must have_ requirement is not included, the project delivery should be considered a failure (note: requirements can be downgraded from _Must have_, by agreement with all relevant stakeholders; for example, when new requirements are deemed more important). _MUST_ can also be considered an [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") for the Minimum Usable Subset.

### Should have

Requirements labelled as _Should have_ are important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox. While _Should have_ requirements can be as important as _Must have_, they are often not as time-critical or there may be another way to satisfy the requirement so that it can be held back until a future delivery timebox.

### Could have

Requirements labelled as _Could have_ are desirable but not necessary and could improve the user experience or customer satisfaction for a little development cost. These will typically be included if time and resources permit.

### Won't have (this time)

Requirements labelled as _Won't have_, have been agreed by stakeholders as the least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at that time. As a result, _Won't have_ requirements are not planned into the schedule for the next delivery timebox. _Won't have_ requirements are either dropped or reconsidered for inclusion in a later timebox. (Note: occasionally the term _Would like to have_ is used; however, that usage is incorrect, as this last priority is clearly stating something is outside the scope of delivery). (The BCS in edition 3 & 4 of the Business Analysis Book describe 'W' as 'Want to have but not this time around')

### Variants\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MoSCoW_method&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Variants")\]

Sometimes W is used to mean _wish_ (or _would_), i.e. still possible but unlikely to be included (and less likely than _could_). This is then distinguished from X for _excluded_ for items which are explicitly not included.

## Use in new product development\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MoSCoW_method&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Use in new product development")\]

In [new product development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development "New product development"), particularly those following agile software development approaches, there is always more to do than there is time or funding to permit (hence the need for prioritization).

For example, should a team have too many potential epics (i.e., high-level [stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story "User story")) for the next release of their product, they could use the _MoSCoW method_ to select which epics are _Must have_, which _Should have_, and so on; the [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product "Minimum viable product") (or MVP) would be all those epics marked as _Must have_.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Oftentimes, a team will find that, even after identifying their MVP, they have too much work for their expected capacity. In such cases, the team could then use the _MoSCoW method_ to select which features (or stories, if that is the subset of epics in their organisation) are _Must have_, _Should have_, and so on; the [minimum marketable features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_funding_methodology "Incremental funding methodology") (or MMF) would be all those marked as _Must have_.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> If there is sufficient capacity after selecting the MVP or MMF, the team could then plan to include _Should have_ and even _Could have_ items too.<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

## Criticism\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MoSCoW_method&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

Criticism of the MoSCoW method includes:

-   Does not help decide between multiple requirements within the same priority.
-   Lack of rationale around how to rank competing requirements: why something is _must_ rather than _should_.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup>
-   Ambiguity over timing, especially on the _Won't have_ category: whether it is not in this release or not ever.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>
-   Potential for political focus on building new features over technical improvements (such as refactoring).<sup id="cite_ref-:1_8-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method#cite_note-:1-8">[8]</a></sup>
