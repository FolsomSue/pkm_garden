# Taxonomy of Service Qualities

The service qualities presently identified in the TRM taxonomy are:

-   **Availability** (the degree to which something is available for use), including:
    -   **Manageability**, the ability to gather information about the state of something and to control it
    -   **Serviceability**, the ability to identify problems and take corrective action, such as to repair or upgrade a component in a running system
    -   **Performance**, the ability of a component to perform its tasks in an appropriate time
    -   **Reliability**, or resistance to failure
    -   **Recoverability**, or the ability to restore a system to a working state after an interruption
    -   **Locatability**, the ability of a system to be found when needed
-   **Assurance**, including:
    -   **Security**, or the protection of information from unauthorized access
    -   **Integrity**, or the assurance that data has not been corrupted
    -   **Credibility**, or the level of trust in the integrity of the system and its data
-   **Usability**, or ease-of-operation by users, including:
    -   **International Operation**, including multi-lingual and multi-cultural abilities
-   **Adaptability**, including:
    -   **Interoperability**, whether within or outside the organization (for instance, interoperability of calendaring or scheduling functions may be key to the usefulness of a system)
    -   **Scalability**, the ability of a component to grow or shrink its performance or capacity appropriately to the demands of the environment in which it operates
    -   **Portability**, of data, people, applications, and components
    -   **Extensibility**, or the ability to accept new functionality
    -   The ability to offer access to services in new paradigms such as object-orientation
