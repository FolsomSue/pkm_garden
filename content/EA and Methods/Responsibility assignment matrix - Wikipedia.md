> A responsibility assignment matrix[1] (RAM), also known as RACI matrix[2] () or linear responsibility chart[3] (LRC), describes the participation by various roles in completing tasks or deliverables for a project or business process. RACI is an acronym derived from the four key responsibilities most typically used: responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed.[4]  It is used for clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional or departmental projects and processes.[5] There are a number of alternatives to the RACI model.

# Responsibility assignment matrix - Wikipedia
A **responsibility assignment matrix**[\[1\]](#cite_note-pmbok-1) (**RAM**), also known as **RACI matrix**[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) () or **linear responsibility chart**[\[3\]](#cite_note-3) (**LRC**), describes the participation by various [roles](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Role "Role") in completing [tasks](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Task_(project_management) "Task (project management)") or [deliverables](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Deliverable "Deliverable") for a [project](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Project "Project") or [business process](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Business_process "Business process"). RACI is an [acronym](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") derived from the four key responsibilities most typically used: _responsible_, _accountable_, _consulted_, and _informed_.[\[4\]](#cite_note-slaguide-4) It is used for clarifying and defining roles and responsibilities in cross-functional or departmental projects and processes.[\[5\]](#cite_note-babok-5) There are a number of alternatives to the RACI model.

Key responsibility roles in RACI model\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Key responsibility roles in RACI model")\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Role distinction\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Role distinction")\]

There is a distinction between a role and individually identified people: a _role_ is a descriptor of an associated set of tasks; may be performed by many people; and one person can perform many roles. For example, an organization may have ten people who can perform the role of _project manager_, although traditionally each project only has one project manager at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of _project manager_ may also be able to perform the role of _business analyst_ and _tester_.

_R = Responsible_ (also _recommender_)

Those who do the work to complete the task.[\[6\]](#cite_note-pmiforum-6) There is at least one role with a participation type of _responsible_, although others can be delegated to assist in the work required (see also _RASCI_ below for separately identifying those who participate in a supporting role).

_A = Accountable_ (also _approver_ or _final approving authority_)

The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, the one who ensures the prerequisites of the task are met and who delegates the work to those _responsible_.[\[6\]](#cite_note-pmiforum-6) In other words, an _accountable_ must sign off (approve) work that _responsible_ provides. There **must** be only one _accountable_ specified for each task or deliverable.[\[7\]](#cite_note-formal-7)

_C = Consulted_ (sometimes _consultant_ or _counsel_)

Those whose opinions are sought, typically [subject-matter experts](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Subject-matter_expert "Subject-matter expert"); and with whom there is two-way communication.[\[6\]](#cite_note-pmiforum-6)

_I = Informed_ (also _informee_)

Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication.[\[6\]](#cite_note-pmiforum-6)

Very often the role that is _accountable_ for a task or deliverable may also be _responsible_ for completing it (indicated on the matrix by the task or deliverable having a role _accountable_ for it, but no role _responsible_ for its completion, i.e. it is implied). Outside of this exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types. Where more than one participation type is shown, this generally implies that participation has not yet been fully resolved, which can impede the value of this technique in clarifying the participation of each role on each task.

Assigning people to facilities\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Assigning people to facilities")\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The matrix is typically created with a vertical axis (left-hand column) of tasks (from a [work breakdown structure](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure "Work breakdown structure")) or deliverables (from a [product breakdown structure](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure "Product breakdown structure")), and a horizontal axis (top row) of roles (from an [organizational chart](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Organizational_chart "Organizational chart")).

Alternatives\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Alternatives")\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of alternatives to the RACI participation types:

### PARIS\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: PARIS")\]

This is an early version[\[8\]](#cite_note-8) of a responsibility assignment matrix, with the roles defined as:

_Participant_

_Accountable_

_Review required_

_Input required_

_Sign-off required_

### PACSI\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: PACSI")\]

This is a version very useful to organizations where the output of activities under the accountability of a single person/function can be reviewed and vetoed by multiple stakeholders, due to the collaborative nature of the culture.

_Perform_

The person/function carrying out the activity.

_Accountable_

The person/function ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and often the one who delegates the work to the performer.

_Control_

The person/function reviewing the result of the activity. They have a right of veto; their advice is binding.

_Suggest_

The person/function consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise. The advice is non-binding.

_Informed_

The person/function who must be informed of the result of the activity.

### RASCI or RASIC\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: RASCI or RASIC")\]

This is an expanded version[\[9\]](#cite_note-9) of the standard RACI, less frequently known as _RASCI_,[\[10\]](#cite_note-10) breaking the _responsible_ participation into:

_Responsible_

Those responsible for the task, who ensure that it is done as per the _approver_

_Support_

Resources allocated to _responsible_. Unlike _consulted_, who may provide input to the task, _support_ helps complete the task.

### RASI\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: RASI")\]

This is an alternative version[\[11\]](#cite_note-LCE_Training-11) of the standard RACI, foregoing the _consulted_ participation and replacing it with:

_Support_

Resources which play a supporting role in implementation.

### RACIQ\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: RACIQ")\]

This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, with an additional participation type:

_Quality review_

Those who check whether the product meets the quality requirements.

### RACI-VS\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: RACI-VS")\]

This is an expanded version[\[4\]](#cite_note-slaguide-4) of the standard RACI, with two additional participation types:

_Verifier_

Those who check whether the [product](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure "Product breakdown structure") meets the [acceptance criteria](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Acceptance_testing "Acceptance testing") set forth in the [product description](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Product_description "Product description").

_Signatory_

Those who approve the _verify_ decision and authorize the product hand-off. It seems to make sense that the _signatory_ should be the party being _accountable_ for its [success](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Successor_(project_management)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Successor (project management) (page does not exist)").

### CAIRO\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: CAIRO")\]

This is an expanded version,[\[12\]](#cite_note-12) of the standard RACI, also known as _RACIO_[\[13\]](#cite_note-13) with one additional participation type.

_Out of the loop_ (or _omitted_)

Designating individuals or groups who are specifically not part of the task. Specifying that a resource does not participate can be as beneficial to a task's completion as specifying those who do participate.

### DACI\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: DACI")\]

Another version that has been used to centralize decision making, and clarify who can re-open discussions.[\[14\]](#cite_note-14)

_Driver_

A single _driver_ of overall project like the person steering a car.

_Approver_

One or more _approver_s who make most project decisions, and are responsible if it fails.

_Contributors_

Are the worker-bees who are responsible for deliverables; and with whom there is two-way communication.

_Informed_

Those who are impacted by the project and are provided status and informed of decisions; and with whom there is one-way communication.

### RAPID\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: RAPID")\]

Another tool used to clarify decision roles and thereby improve decision making, is **RAPID**, which was created by and is a registered trademark of [Bain & Company](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wiki/Bain_%26_Company "Bain & Company").

_Recommend_

The _recommend_ role typically involves 80 percent of the work in a decision. The recommender gathers relevant input and proposes a course of action—sometimes alternative courses, complete with pros and cons so that the decision maker's choices are as clear, simple and timely as possible.

_Agree_

The _agree_ role represents a formal approval of a recommendation. The 'A' and the 'R' should work together to come to a mutually satisfactory proposal to bring forward to the decider. But not all decisions will need an agree role, as this is typically reserved for those situations where some form of regulatory or compliance sign-off is required.

_Perform_

The _perform_ role defines who is accountable for executing or implementing the decision once it is made. Best-practice companies typically define P's and gather input from them early in the process

_Input_

The _input_ role provides relevant information and facts so that the recommender and decider can assess all the relevant facts to make the right decision. However, the 'I' role is strictly advisory. Recommenders should consider all input, but they don't have to reflect every point of view in the final recommendation.

_Decide_

The _Decide_ role is for the single person who ultimately is accountable for making the final decision, committing the group to action and ensuring the decision gets implemented.

### RATSI\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: RATSI")\]

Another tool used in organization design or roles analysis.

_Responsibility_

Identify who is in charge of making sure the work is done.

_Authority_

Identify who has final decision power on the work.

_Task_

Identify who actually does the work.

_Support_

Identify who is involved to provide support to the work.

_Informed_

Identify who is informed that the work has been done (or will be started)

### DRASCI\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: DRASCI")\]

A variant of RASCI developed by three Whitehall theorists (Kane, Jackson, Gilbert). This scheme is adapted for use in matrix management environments, and differs only from RASCI in having an additional role of _Driver_ and a narrower definition of _Support_:

_Driver_

An individual or party that assists those who are _responsible_ for delivering a task by both producing supporting collateral and setting timescales for delivery in line with the overarching aim of the individual or party who is _accountable_ for the overall accomplishment of the objective. The distinction between _driver_ and _support_ lies in that the former reinforces and clarifies the parameters of the task on behalf of those who are _accountable_, while the latter refers to those who help those who are _responsible_ in reaching a given goal.

### PDQA\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: PDQA")\]

A version developed at U Tokyo and MIT for model-based project management. The PDQA set of roles corresponds to demand for capabilities of teams. Roles include those for work on scope, handling of dependencies as coordination, and exception handling through error detection and decisions across a project organization. PDQA is used in agent-based modeling to simulate the supply of these capabilities by teams in projects.[\[15\]](#cite_note-15)

_Primary_

Provides skill-based effort within capacity to complete scope and also manages dependencies through coordination.

_Decision_

Handles any decision, including scope acceptable and exception handling decisions leading to rework. (Does not generation nominal scope).

_Quality_

Reviews scope as it progresses to detect poor quality and escalates to decision-maker as so. (Does not general nominal scope).

_Assist_

Provides skill-based effort with the capacity to complete scope, in assistance to the primary. (Does not manage dependencies through coordination).

### DCI\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: DCI")\]

A minimal set of decision-making categories used in organisation design or roles analysis.

_Decision maker_

Individuals who make the decision and is accountable for its impact on the business.

_Consulted_

Individuals accountable for providing guidance based on functional expertise and experience, highlighting issues and raising alternatives to support the Decision Maker.

_Informed_

Impacted stakeholders are notified after the decision has been made and who will need to support the execution of the decision.

### RASCEIO\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: RASCEIO")\]

To be used when working on governance, risk, compliance (GRC) and outsourcing matters:

_Responsible_

_Accountable_

_Support_

_Consult_

_Execute_

Third parties contracted to execute activities in accordance with a service level agreement

_Inform_

_Overview_

Key GRC roles, such as risk owner, policy owner - where accountability is devolved, but a role is needed to oversee whether accountabilities all fit together

Variations\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Variations")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are also a number of variations to the meaning of RACI participation types:

### RACI (alternative scheme)\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: RACI (alternative scheme)")\]

There is an alternative _coding_, less widely published but used by some practitioners and process mapping software, which modifies the application of the _R_ and _A_ codes of the original scheme. The overall methodology remains the same but this alternative avoids potential confusion of the terms _accountable_ and _responsible_, which may be understood by management professionals but not always so clearly differentiated by others:

_Responsible_

Those responsible for the performance of the task. There should be exactly one person with this assignment for each task.

_Assists_

Those who assist in the completion of the task

_Consulted_

Those whose opinions are sought; and with whom there is two-way communication.

_Informed_

Those who are kept up-to-date on progress; and with whom there is one-way communication.

### ARCI (decisions)\[[edit](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/w/index.php?title=Responsibility_assignment_matrix&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: ARCI (decisions)")\]

This alternative is focused only on documenting who has the authority to make which decisions. This can work across all sized workgroups.

_Accountable_

Authorized to _approve_ an answer to the decision.

_Responsible_

Responsible to _recommend_ an answer to the decision.

_Consulted_

Those whose opinions are sought, and with whom there is two-way communication.

_Informed_

Those who are informed after the decision is made, and with whom there is one-way communication.
