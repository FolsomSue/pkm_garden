# System Integration Modelling Using UML
For the integration of IT systems, we need to define _which_ information needs to be exchanged and _how_ it will be exchanged. For this reason, the _system integration model_ consists of two different views: the _process view_ and the _static view_.

In system integration, the main focus is on process steps that are significantly important for the interaction, exchange of messages, between IT systems and/or involved parties. Nevertheless, often process steps are described that do not necessarily exchange messages, but are important for the complete comprehension of the process. An example of this could be the unloading of the luggage of passengers who did not board the airplane (action _unload luggage_ in the activity _no boarding_).

The _static view_ describes the _content_ and _structure_ of the business objects that are exchanged between partners.

The _process view_ depicts those _activities_ that an IT system passes through when it exchanges messages with other IT systems. Purely technical processes that are necessary for communication between IT systems, such as dial-up or other connection to the Internet, are not the subject of the process view of our model.
