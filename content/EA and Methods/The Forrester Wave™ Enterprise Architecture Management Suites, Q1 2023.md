# Requirements
As a result of these trends, EAMS customers should look for providers that:
-   Provide insights capabilities that drive transformation. Internal stakeholders are no longer satisfied with using pure modeling tools to make tactical and strategic decisions. To truly enable organizations to transform the experience of internal and external stakeholders, improve product and service delivery, and optimize internal processes, enterprise architects must have the ability to provide proactive and dynamic insights that drive value delivery. Dynamic modeling, scenario analysis, and maturity assessments must be performed in near real-time through configurable scripts and algorithms or through the adoption of AI technologies. 
-   Enable organizations to experiment with organizational change. To succeed in transformation, internal stakeholders must advance the adoption of new operating arrangements and practices, raise the quality of employee and stakeholder engagement, and realize the tangible and intangible value from change. Enterprise architects should look for an EAMS that enriches change by providing modeling, assessments, analytics, and visualization of customer-facing and operating model architectures. These capabilities enable all stakeholders to experiment with different architectural configurations to determine the best architecture to support the organization’s vision, mission, and strategy.    
-   Protect the assets and brand of the organization. When implemented correctly, an organization’s sustainability, security, and resilience efforts build trust, improve the brand, and open new markets. Successful implementation requires organizations to have architectural views that highlight strategic misalignments, immature capabilities, and weaknesses in the enterprise, business, and technology architectures. Enterprise architects must provide their internal stakeholders with awareness of architectural compliance issues regarding regulations and standards and a pathway to a future fit operating model that addresses sustainability, security, and resilience.
