The Pomodoro® Technique is organised into six incremental objectives
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*   1
    
    Find out how much effort an activity requires
    ---------------------------------------------
    
    Ever wonder where all your time goes? Wonder no more: it’s all on the page. Your Pomodoro® To-Do sheet is a visual overview of the time you’ve spent on various tasks.
    
*   2
    
    Cut down on interruptions
    -------------------------
    
    Usually, you can afford to take 25 minutes before calling back a friend or replying to an email. You’ll learn how to handle the inevitable interruption while staying focused on the task at hand.
    
*   3
    
    Estimate the effort for activities
    ----------------------------------
    
    Once you’ve gotten the hang of the technique, you’ll be able to accurately predict how many Pomodoros it will take to accomplish tomorrow’s -- or next month’s -- tasks.
    
*   4
    
    Make the Pomodoro® more effective
    ---------------------------------
    
    While the contours of the Pomodoro® are set, what you do within them can be adjusted to maximize efficiency. One way to make a Pomodoro® more effective is to use the first few minutes to review what you’ve done before. Other methods are discussed in the book.
    
*   5
    
    Set up a timetable
    ------------------
    
    A timetable sets a limit, motivating you to complete a task within a set period of time. It also delineates your work time from your free time. Creating a clear timetable will allow you to enjoy your time off without worrying that you could be doing more work.
    
*   6
    
    Define your own objectives
    --------------------------
    
    The Pomodoro® Technique is a tool you can use to reach your own objectives. For example, a writer might realize he’s spending too much time revising, and adjust his Pomodoro® timetable to allow for more brainstorming time.

How the Pomodoro® will change you
---------------------------------

By applying the Pomodoro® Technique you can manage to:

*   ##### Handle interruptions
    
    No more mistakes due to lack of concentration.
    
    No more wrong estimates, rework, stress and overtime.
    
*   ##### Reduce the length and number of meetings
    
    No more long, exhausting and useless meetings.
    
*   ##### Reduce estimation errors
    
    learn to simplify and organize tasks
    
    No more wrong estimates on complex, undefined and uncertain tasks.
    
*   ##### Improve motivation by improving the content of work
    
    learn to understand the effort a task will take, reduce the complexity of tasks that need doing, organize your time
    
    No more lack of confidence, lack of responsibility and lack of trust between team members.
    
*   ##### Transform time from being an enemy to being an ally in order to achieve your goals
    
    take regular breaks, learn to observe yourself and your team and improve your work process
    
    No more work under pressure.
    
    No more tensions between team members.
    
    No more fear of being accountable.
    
*   ##### Meet deadlines without time pressure
    
    learn to transform a complex goal into a series of simpler goals to be reached and hence increase your motivation, the precision of the estimates and the probability of final success
    
    No more missed deadlines and costly delays.
    
*   ##### Share with your team members the same point of view about what to do
    
    No more doubts about what to do, who has to do what and when something will be done.
    
*   ##### Create an effective team timetable to reach multiple goals, handle unplanned events, tasks, emergencies and change
    
    No more bottlenecks and interruptions.
    
    No more frictions between team members.
    
*   ##### Reduce the complexity of your goals and the relative uncertainty of reaching them
    
    by learning to transform deeply nested hierarchies of tasks into linear task lists: task lists without dangerous bottlenecks and interdependencies between tasks
    
    No more complex, unmanageable and unreachable goals.
    
*   ##### Optimise the interaction between team members needed to complete tasks
    
    no communication overflow
    
    No more thousands of instant messages, emails and calls interrupting your work flow.

The Pomodoro® Core Process
--------------------------

For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro® Technique teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use.

**The Pomodoro® Core Process consists of 6 steps:**

![](chrome-extension://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0257/1675/t/154/assets/how_1.png?v=2023530922395619069)

##### 1\. Choose a task you'd like to get done

Something big, something small, something you’ve been putting off for a million years: it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s something that deserves your full, undivided attention.

![](chrome-extension://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0257/1675/t/154/assets/how_2.png?v=3307585564617080296)

##### 2\. Set the Pomodoro® for 25 minutes

Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this task and I will not interrupt myself. You can do it! After all, it’s just 25 minutes.

![](chrome-extension://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0257/1675/t/154/assets/how_3.png?v=15093776274879868177)

##### 3\. Work on the task until the Pomodoro® rings

Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes. If you suddenly realize you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of paper.

##### 4\. When the Pomodoro® rings, put a checkmark on a paper

Congratulations! You’ve spent an entire, interruption-less Pomodoro® on a task.

##### 5\. Take a short break

Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.

##### 6\. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break

Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a longer break. 20 minutes is good. Or 30. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.
