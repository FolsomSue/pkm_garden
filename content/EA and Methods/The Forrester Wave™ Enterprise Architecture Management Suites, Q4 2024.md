### EAM Suites Help Architects Manage Tech Complexity And Business Outcomes

Architects use enterprise architecture management (EAM) suites to manage a variety of strategic and daily activities — such as analyzing and managing enterprisewide application and technology estates; influencing strategic direction; and tracking the results of architectural change — and to provide insights into the performance of the EA organization. While these suites aren’t new, their providers continue to invest in tools that help enterprise architects demonstrate the value of their discipline in enabling business transformation: The latest iterations offer digital twins, EA democratization, AI smart agents, AI chatbots, demand management features, and architecture decision records. These capabilities help architects innovate and become more influential, agile, accountable, and collaborative.

### Contenders

#### North Highland

Founded in 1992, North Highland is a management consulting firm specializing in change and transformation. Its NH360 platform integrates strategic portfolio management with enterprise architecture, offering organizations a comprehensive view of their applications, processes, information, and technology landscape to support transformation initiatives.

1. **Strategy.** North Highland has on-par scores for vision, innovation, roadmap, and adoption. Its ongoing innovation aims to create a transformational intelligence platform, using AI to help with what-if scenario analysis, risk identification, and roadmap generation. The firm delivers roadmap features monthly; it proactively shares new tool features with customers to gain customer input and boost adoption. However, North Highland doesn’t engage enough with the wider community because of its focus on working with core clients and consulting. And with just one partnership, it needs to expand its partner ecosystem.
2. **Capabilities.** North Highland’s strategic portfolio management capability excels at aligning strategic initiatives with extensive capabilities like investment governance, resource management, roadmapping, and dependency management; it includes a full range of execution methodologies like agile and waterfall. Its suite lags in terms of broader AI features, IT carbon footprint calculation and reporting, architecture decision records, and integration ecosystem.
3. **Customer feedback.** Customers noted that North Highland acts with integrity and has an outstanding onboarding/training program. They told us that it could improve its external communications and, more importantly, its customer community.

Its partner ecosystem is quite large, with resellers worldwide. Trerado, Sparx Systems’ next-generation collaborative cloud platform, supports highly transparent pricing. However, it lags in its vision and community: It lacks a clear business focus other than BPMN diagramming, and it has a history of limited customer community interactions, although this is now changing.
2. **Capabilities.** Sparx Systems scores above par for fostering API and microservices usage: Users can fully model, manage, and monitor application landscape decoupling as well as track costs. The firm also scores highly for its mature management of architecture decision records. It must invest in AI smart agents, EA democratization, low-code/no-code, and demand management capabilities to improve its offering.
3. **Customer feedback.** Sparx Systems customers find the tool is easy to use; it includes powerful modeling capabilities, especially UML, for a reasonable price.
4. **Forrester’s take.** EA professionals looking for an application architecture platform that has successfully integrated TOGAF, ArchiMate, and UML should consider Sparx Systems.

View [Sparx Systems’ detailed scorecard](https://forrester.com/insights/technology-landscapes-and-waves/technology/enterprise-architecture-management-suites/MA-230/profiles/VE-5780).

#### Bee360

Bee360, founded in 2003, focuses on how an EAM suite can enable business and IT transformation with a holistic and pragmatic view.

1. **Strategy.** Bee360 has on-par scores for its vision, roadmap, and partner ecosystem. The vendor’s vision involves a holistic approach to enable better decision-making. It bases the success of its strategy on close collaboration with customers: Its roadmap includes customer-validated features delivered quarterly or monthly. Bee360’s partner ecosystem comprises managed service providers, consulting partners, and technology partners worldwide. However, its scores for innovation, adoption, and community lag. While targeting the C-suite can sometimes be beneficial, engaging with customer success managers will make a difference in adoption. Its community consists only of standard channels, so it needs to incorporate quality assessments.
2. **Capabilities.** Bee360’s demand management stands out: This feature is available either inside the EA tool or users can import it; demand prioritization includes business and IT criteria to help architects make data-driven decisions. However, the firm lags on several criteria that help empower architects, such as digital twin, democratization with AI, architecture process mining, fostering API and microservices use, and architecture decision records.
3. **Customer feedback.** Customers viewed Bee360 as a vendor with high ethical standards that provides high-quality customer support and is highly dependable. However, they noted that its external communications, customer community, and customer recommendations could be better.
4. **Forrester’s take.** EA professionals looking for an EA tool that serves strategic and day-to-day architecture tasks should consider Bee360.

### Vendor Offerings

Forrester evaluated the offerings listed below (see Figure 3).

![[c291232a18de983c48dc9cdff01e9542.png|This table lists the products that Forrester evaluated for this report. This graphic has an associated spreadsheet that includes all data presented. Please access the spreadsheet for details.]]

Figure 3 - Evaluated Vendors And Product Information

### Evaluation Overview

We evaluated vendors against three categories:

1. **Current offering.** Each vendor’s position on the vertical axis of the Forrester Wave graphic indicates the strength of its current offering.
2. **Strategy.** Placement on the horizontal axis indicates the strength of the vendors’ strategies, including elements such as vision and innovation.
3. **Customer feedback.** A halo on a vendor’s marker indicates above-average customer feedback relative to the other evaluated vendors. A double halo indicates outstanding customer feedback: We consider the vendor to be a Customer Favorite. As part of this evaluation, we speak with up to three customers of each vendor. We also consider customer input from our previous research.

#### Vendor Inclusion Criteria

Each of the vendors we included in this assessment has:

1. **An EAM suite with more than $10 million in revenue.** Forrester included vendors that have more than $10 million in revenue for their EAM suite.
2. **Significant revenue and customer presence in at least two regions.** Forrester included vendors that have a significant presence (of both revenue and customer count) in at least two regions: North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.
3. **Foundational EAM suite capabilities that clients commonly request.** Forrester included vendors with proven foundational EAM suite capabilities and competitive capabilities that clients commonly request, with the appropriate partnerships and support models to allow integration into a customer’s technology and business landscape.
4. **Forrester mindshare.** Forrester included vendors that peers often mentioned as competitors in client bids in our [overview of this market](https://www.forrester.com/go?objectid=res180934) or that were frequently brought up in analyst briefings, inquiries, and interviews.

#### Other Notable Vendors

The Forrester Wave evaluation is an assessment of the top vendors in the market; it doesn’t represent the entire vendor landscape. You’ll find more information about this market and additional vendors that Forrester considers to be notable for enterprise clients in our corresponding report: [The Enterprise Architecture Management Suites Landscape, Q2 2024](https://www.forrester.com/go?objectid=res180934).

### Supplemental Material

#### The Forrester Wave Methodology

A Forrester Wave is a guide for buyers considering their purchasing options in a technology marketplace. To offer an equitable process for all participants, Forrester follows [The Forrester Wave™ Methodology](https://www.forrester.com/policies/forrester-wave-methodology/) to evaluate participating vendors.

In our review, we conduct primary research to develop a list of vendors to consider for the evaluation. From that initial pool of vendors, we narrow our final list based on the inclusion criteria. We then gather details of product and strategy through a detailed questionnaire, demos and briefings, and interviews with customers (vendors may provide up to three reference customers; we also consider feedback from other customers we've spoken with). We use those inputs, along with the analyst’s experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors, using a relative rating system that compares each vendor against the others in the evaluation.

We include the publishing date (quarter and year) clearly in the title of each Forrester Wave report. We evaluated the vendors participating in this Forrester Wave using materials they provided to us by September 23, 2024, and did not allow additional information after that point. We encourage readers to evaluate how the market and vendor offerings change over time.

In accordance with [our vendor review policy](https://www.forrester.com/policies/wave-vendor-review-policy/), Forrester asks vendors to review our findings prior to publishing to check for accuracy. We score vendors that met our defined inclusion criteria but declined to participate in or contributed only partially to the evaluation in accordance with [our vendor participation policy](https://www.forrester.com/policies/wave-vendor-nonparticipation-policy) and publish their positioning along with those of the participating vendors.

BOC Group and SAP LeanIX declined to participate in the full Forrester Wave evaluation process. For vendors that are not full participants, Forrester uses primary and secondary research in its analysis. For example, we might use public information, data gathered via briefings, and independently sourced customer interviews to score the vendor. We may ask the vendor for an abbreviated briefing and/or to provide reference customers. We may also rely on estimates to score vendors.

#### Integrity Policy

We conduct all our research, including Forrester Wave evaluations, in accordance with the [integrity policy](https://www.forrester.com/policies/integrity-policy) posted on our website.
