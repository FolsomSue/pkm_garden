The best way to ensure all your data and settings are brought over is through **Backup and Restore**.

**On computer A:**

- Create a backup using **Menu > File > Backup**.
- Deactivate your license if you are no longer going to use eM Client on this device in **Menu > Help > License**.
- Find the .ZIP backup file and move it to computer B (default in *…\\Documents\\eM Client*).

**On computer B:**

- Install eM Client ([http://www.emclient.com/download](http://www.emclient.com/download)).
- Skip initial setup.
- Restore from your backup through **Menu > File > Restore**. If you put the backup file in this device in the same folder structure as the default (*…\\Documents\\eM Client*) the restore will find it right away, otherwise, you’ll need to specify the path where the backup file can be found.
- Activate your license in **Menu > Help > License**. If you have lost your license activation key, you can have it resent to you from [this page](https://www.emclient.com/lost-activation-key).
