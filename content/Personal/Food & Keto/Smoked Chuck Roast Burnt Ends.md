# Smoked Chuck Roast Burnt Ends

I selected and purchased (2) chuck roasts that were about 3 lbs each and had even thickness and were nicely marbled with fat.

This a great size to work with for this purpose.

Place the chuck roasts into a lidded container.

Pour about 1 cup of Worcestershire sauce over the top of the meat.

Add a good sprinkling of Jeff's original rub onto the top of the meat.

Use a sharp knife to carefully make cuts into the meat down to about the center.

This will pull some of the rub down into the meat along with the liquid.

Carefully drizzle about another ½ cup of Worcestershire sauce onto the top of the meat. Do it slowly so as to not wash the rub away.

The Worcestershire will seep down into the holes we just made and that's a good thing!

Place the lid on the container and place it in the fridge overnight or for at least 4 hours if possible.

When you are ready to start smoking the chuck roast, remove the meat from the fridge but don't rinse it or do anything to it. It will come out of the plastic container and go into the smoker as is.

Preheat your smoker to 240°F using indirect heat.

If your smoker has a water pan, fill it up.

You will need enough wood chips to produce smoke for at least 4 hours but longer is ok as long as the smoke is light.

Once the smoker is ready, place the chuck roast(s) on a Weber grill pan, Bradley rack or cooking rack to make it easy to take it out to the smoker.

Smoke the meat for 7-8 hours or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat reads about 190°F.

Much more than this and the meat may be too tender to cut into cubes.

I recommend a digital probe meat thermometer such as the [“Smoke” by Thermoworks](https://www.smoking-meat.com/smoke) to monitor the temperature of the meat while it cooks.

I did not at any time wrap the meat in foil. You can if you like but it does mess with the crust formation and to me that is a very important part.

The chuck roast should have nice dark, deep mahogany crust when it is finished cooking.

At this point, you could slice the chuck roast and eat it but why do that when you can make burnt ends out of them!

Carry on, stay focused and your patience will reward you greatly!

Lay the chuck roast on the cutting board.

Cut it into bite sized cubes.. bite sizes may vary.

Into a pan..

Add some of my delicious, better than any sauce you've ever tasted [original barbecue sauce](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order) ( [Purchase formula here](https://smoking-meat.com/order)  | [Purchase bottled sauce](https://thinbluefoods.com/collections/all) ).

Go head and get happy with it.. don't hold back.

Use a spatula to turn the cubes of meat over and over a few times to get the sauce onto every square inch of surface area.

Now sprinkle Jeff's original rub ( [Purchase formula here](https://smoking-meat.com/order)  | [Purchase bottled rub](https://thinbluefoods.com/collections/all) ) all over the top of the meat and once again, use a spatula to turn them over a few times and make sure they are well coated.

Add more rub if you need it. Every piece should have a fair amount on it.

This sauce and rub combination becomes your crust and is essential to the final product.

Here is where you have a few options:

**Use the Smoker**

Place the pan back into the smoker for about 2 hours at 240°F stirring the meat every 30 minutes.

You can add more smoke if you like and the flavor will be really good.

**Use the Grill**

Place the pan of of cubed meat onto the grill over high heat and stir around every few minutes until the outside of the pieces are as dark and caramelized as you like.

**Use the  Broiler on the Oven**

Yeah, yeah.. it works so why not!

Works just like the grill except it cooks them from the top down rather than from the bottom up.

Stir them around every few minutes and when they get to the desired color and are deeply caramelized, they are done.. get them out of there!

I love just sitting these on the table as appetizers and letting folks just grab and eat but they also work great as a main entree with a couple of sides or you can pile them high on a bun with your favorite toppings.

The sky's the limit with these bad boys!
