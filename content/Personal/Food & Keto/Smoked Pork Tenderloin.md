# Smoked Pork Tenderloin
While much of the pork that we smoke and grill is anything but healthy, **smoked pork tenderloin** rivals lean white meat chicken in calories, fat and cholesterol. Eat it because it tastes amazingÂ and enjoy the fact that it's also healthy!

*   Mayonnaise (optional)
*   Yellow mustard (optional)
*   [Jeff's original rub recipe](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes") ([purchase recipes here](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order the Recipes for Jeff's rub and sauce - Includes Jeff's new Texas style rub recipe"))

These often come packaged in sets of (2) and it rarely says so on the package for some reason. A good way to tell is by the weightâ€“ most tenderloins will weigh around 1 lb each so a 2 lb package probably has (2) tenderloins. If it says 1.17 lbs, there's probably only one in there.

Remove these from the package and give them a good rinse under cold water.

Pat dry with a paper towel and lay them on the cutting board.

Use a very sharp knife to remove the silverskin that will often be along one side.

Slip the knife under one end and just follow it to the end. If you miss a partÂ of it, just give it another go.

While you have the knife in hand, it's a good idea to remove any excess fat as well.

I normally use [my original rub](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes") on all pork but I wanted to try out the Texas style recipe on these pork tenderloins so I did one with the original recipe and one with the Texas style recipe. ([purchase recipes here](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes"))

As an afterthought, I also decided to use a different sticking base for each one.

Mayonnaise contains oil and egg and makes a great base for applying rub and helping it to stick. I often use this on chicken but felt it would marry better with [the Texas style rub recipe](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes").

I used my normal mustard base with [the original rub recipe](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes") on the other pork tenderloin.

Make sure to get the rub applied well to all sides and the ends.

![2015-IMG_8274](https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2015-IMG_8274.jpg)

Set up your smoker for cooking at 225-240Â°F.

If your smoker came with a water pan, use it.

When your smoker is up to temperature and holding steady, it's time to cook.

I placed the tenderloins on a [Bradley rack](https://www.smoking-meat.com/bradley-racks "Bradley Racks") to make it easy but you can also just place them directly on the smoker grate.

Keep the smoke going for at least 1 hour but it's ok to keep a light smoke going for the entire time as well. Cherry wood smoke goes great with this pork.

I highly recommend the use of a remote [digital probe meat thermometer](https://www.smoking-meat.com/smoke "Smoke 2-Channel Alarm Thermometer by Thermoworks") and you have plenty of options for these.

The [Smoke by ThermoWorks](https://smoking-meat.com/smoke) is my usual go to thermometer for things like this. The probe stays in the meat throughout the entire cook and is attached to the sending unit that sits next to the smoker.

The receiver is in my pocket or next to me where I can see it.

In this way, I have constant knowledge of the smoker temperature and the meat temperature without having to walk out to the smoker.

Is that lazy or just efficient? ðŸ˜‰

Is it vitally important that the pork tenderloin be **removed from the smoker at 145Â°F**. This is the safe temperature for pork.

It should take about **1.5 to 2 hours** for the pork tenderloins to reach 145Â°F.

![2015-IMG_8277](https://www.smoking-meat.com/image-files/2015-IMG_8277.jpg)

Place a foil pan or a piece of foil over the tenderloins for about 10 minutes to let them rest.

Once rested, slice the pork into pieces and serve immediately.

**How about grilling?**

Pork tenderloin, like chicken, can be cooked hotter if you prefer and even cooked on the grill but I recommend indirect heat for all options.

No matter how hot you decide to cook it, watch the temperature of the meat carefully and when it reaches 145Â°F, it is done.

**Round vs. Oval Slices**

I am ok with the oval slices and because this reduces the thickness of the meat, it gets done faster if you just let it lay soft of flattened out.

If you want perfectly round slices, use some cooking twine to tie up the pork tenderloin in about 3-4 places along the length of it. This will hold it in a round shape but will take slightly longer to cook due to the increased diameter.

_"Love the sauce and [rub recipes](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes"). So far I have used them onÂ beef ribs, pork ribs, and different chicken parts. Can't wait to do a beef brisket. Texas rub is great as well!"Â **~PeterÂ S.**_

_"I tried the rub on a beef brisket and someÂ beef ribsÂ the other day and our entire family enjoyed it tremendously. I also made a batch of the barbeque sauce that we used on the brisket as well as some chicken. We all agreed it was the best sauce we have had in a while."Â **~DarwynÂ B.**_

_"Love the original rib rub and sauce! We have an annual rib fest competition at the lake every 4th of July. I will say we have won a great percent of the time over the past 15 years so we are not novices by any means. However, we didn't win last year and had to step up our game! We used [Jeff's rub](https://www.smoking-meat.com/order "Order Recipes") and sauce (sauce on the side) and it was a landslide win for us this year! Thanks Jeff for the great recipes.
