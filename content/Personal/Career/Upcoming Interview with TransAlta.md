# Upcoming Interview with TransAlta
#Career #Prospects

## Interviewer(s) 
* James  Taylor  — mgr of the arch group (?)
* Jemma Smith — mgr IT app 
* Yung Zhang — mgr it service architecture
Time / Location: 11am … 

## Notes
* starting over (how many do-overs)
* context in meeting
* what would I do?
* describe roadmaps, EA approaches
* provide examples
* describe depth of knowledge and expertise
* they are looking to be educated

## Questions for them
* How many reboots of EA?
* Scope of the enterprise (for the purposes of the scope of EA efforts)?
* Who is the audience / customer for EA deliverables? IT? The company as a whole? Partners?
* Cultural Concerns
	* How likely is the company to accept proposed changes of direction?
	* Is it a big-picture / big-project company or a slice-and-dice type in its approach(es) to change
	* Are there particular OCM concerns?
	* Is there a need to identify / satisfy "quick-wins"?
* Pre-existing Technology Decisions
	* Goals with Cloud adoption
	* SAP to transform the business… or to serve it?
* Regulatory Concerns
* Is the driver establishing an EA practice vs. initially advising the enterprise based on EA recommendations / approaches?
* Is the role primarily for a generalist vs one specializing in an EA domain (application, technology, business, information, <security>)

## Approaches to take
* Determine current capability levels / assessments
	* Funding drivers (CAPEX, OPEX)
	* On-prem expertise vs. Cloud advantages
		* May be related to regulatory requirements
* Establish EA principles (for EA, infrastructure, etc.)
	* Operational principles?
	* Application Architecture principles?
* Define parallel / dependent strategic streams
* Determine methodologies / strictness
	* Depends on audience for deliverables
	* Also relies on pre-existing goals, objectives, etc.
		* (Sort of like the ArchiMate Motivational view: goals, outcomes, value, stakeholders, constraints, principles, drivers…)
* Determine pre-existing dependencies / overriding technologies in place
	* E.g. SAP drives a company’s structures, approaches... not the other way around
* Re-use whatever is appropriate whenever possible
	* Principles, standards, reference architectures...

## Examples to provide
* eHO re blueprint, scope of enterprise
* eHO re TOGAF not a good fit for non-architects
* eHO / OPS re methodology / “large” tools (like Troux)
	* Prefer pragmatic methodologies, language, artifacts
	* Take a subset of TOGAF and Zachman, but tailor artifacts for lay person (I.e. non-EA staff)
	* Leverage common COTS / open-source tools and standards for running / documenting EA
		* ArchiMate, mind maps, markdown-based knowledge bases, collaboration tools like Confluence, Teams
* eHO re HIAL (similar to AESO Data Fabric)
* AESO re iteraplan for system EA landscape
* AESO re Data Fabric as an IT-driven goal
	* To be realized via separate roadmaps
	* Driving network and security roadmaps
	* Driving application architecture standards and principles
	* Driving business application planning re capabilities to expose
* AESO re infrastructure roadmaps driving adoption of converged infrastructure 
	* Adopted for mission-critical EMS environment
	* Adopted SAN technologies, also from roadmaps
* AESO re separate but parallel roadmap development
	* Infrastructure (server, storage, network)
	* Cloud migration / adoption 
	* End User Computing
	* Security (edge, internal network, application architectures)
* AESO re streams (productivity stream, technical innovation stream re the goals of
	* modernizing the workplace
	* attracting younger (“millennial / centennial") talent
	* competitive / industry advantage / improvement
* Tools I typically used / use:
	* **Mind Maps** (iThoughts, Mind Manager, XMind)
	* Diagrams (Visio or equivalent)
	* Knowledge Base (DEVONthink, TagSpaces)
	* Models (**archimate**, **Sparx EA**)
	* Notes / outlining (iThoughts, Markdown editors)
	* Roadmaps (**Office Timeline**, Visio)
	* Documents (Word, PowerPoint)
	* Gartner / Forrester, Ovum

## Special Interest / Stuff about me
* Keto lifestyle
* Smoking meat
* Volunteer activities (ALS Society)
* Gadget enthusiast / early adopter (e.g. Yubikeys)
* Tinkering with self-hosted / non-tech oligoplies technologies
