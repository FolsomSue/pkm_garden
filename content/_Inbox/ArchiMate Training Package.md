- ArchiMate Training Package
	- Need to align with APM+
		- Additions to APM+ are possible and useful, but won't be leveraged by the APM+ dashboards / scripts out of the box 
		- No simple associations when possible
		- Flow relations between application components, with Data Objects assigned to the flow relation
			- No bidirectional flows in ArchiMate, so separate flows will be needed in some cases (but can share Data Objects)
		- App Components will Serve Business Actors, which we assume are having the role of Business Unit
			- Different roles can be defined but aren't used by APM+
	- Sections
		- History
		- Overview of Aspects and Layers
		- Overview of Relationships
		- Suggested Relationships
		- Composition vs. Aggregation vs. Nesting
		- Stereotypes (BizzDesign-focused)
		- Overview of APM+ -related elements
	- Audience
		- EAs, SAs, BAs
		- Management -- different slides
	- Advice
		- If it's structural, it's best represented via elements and relationships
			- E.g. Business Units and what they are using
		- If it's informative, it's likely best captured in attributes within BizzDesign
			- E.g. Business Units owning / funding percentage of components, services
			- Non-atomic information can be parsed from a list-like capability of APM+
		- Composition vs. Aggregation
			- Use Composition for elements of the same time, where the "parent" is made up of its children, which are a part of the composition
				- "Part of" relationship
			- Use Aggregation for elements that may be have several aggregation "parents"
				- "Has a" relationship
		-  Landscapes
			- Use App Components, with flows + associated data objects to represent integrations
			- Define BU alignment by App Components Serving BU Business Actors
	- Caveats
		- Custom attributes / properties cannot be imported from Archi
			- The attributes are exported from Archi, but ignored by BizzDesign
