## Basic of Flowchart: Meaning and Symbols

Flowcharts are the ideal diagrams for visually representing business processes. For example, if you need to show the flow of a custom-order process through various departments within your organization, you can use a flowchart. This paper provides a visual representation of basic flowchart diagram symbols and their proposed use in communicating the structure of a well-developed web site, as well as their correlation in developing on-line instructional projects. A typical flowchart from older Computer Science textbooks may have the following kinds of symbols.

## What do Flowchart Shapes Mean?

| Symbols | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Start** and **end** | Represented as lozenges, ovals or rounded rectangles, usually containing the word "Start" or "End", or another phrase signaling the start or end of a process, such as "submit enquiry" or "receive product". |
| **Arrows** | Showing what's called "flow of control" in computer science. An arrow coming from one symbol and ending at another symbol signifies flow passes to the symbol the arrow points to. |
| **Processing steps** | Represented as rectangles. Examples: "Add 1 to X"; "replace identified part"; "save changes" or similar. |
| **Input/Output** | Represented as a parallelogram. Examples: Get X from the user; display X. |
| **Conditional** (or **decision**) | Represented as a diamond (rhombus). These typically contain a Yes/No question or True/False test. This symbol is unique in that it has two arrows coming out of it, usually from the bottom point and right point, one corresponding to Yes or True, and one corresponding to No or False. The arrows should always be labeled. More than two arrows can be used, but this is normally a clear indicator that a complex decision is being taken, in which case it may need to be broken-down further, or replaced with the "pre-defined process" symbol. |

A number of other symbols that have less universal currency, such as:

<table><tbody><tr><td>A <b>Document</b></td><td>Represented as a rectangle with a wavy base;</td></tr><tr><td>A <b>Manual input</b></td><td>Represented by a rectangle, with the top irregularly sloping up from left to right. An example would be to signify data-entry from a form;</td></tr><tr><td>A <b>Manual operation</b></td><td>Represented by a trapezoid with the longest parallel side upmost, to represent an operation or adjustment to process that can only be made manually;</td></tr><tr><td>A <b>Data File</b></td><td>Represented by a cylinder.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Basic Process of Flowchart

Flowcharts may contain other symbols, such as connectors, usually represented as circles, to represent converging paths in the flow chart. Circles will have more than one arrow coming into them but only one going out. Some flow charts may just have an arrow point to another arrow instead. These are useful to represent an iterative process (in Computer Science this is called a loop). A loop may, for example, consist of a connector where control first enters, processing steps, a conditional with one arrow exiting the loop, and one going back to the connector. Off-page connectors are often used to signify a connection to a (part of a) process held on another sheet or screen.

A flowchart is described as "cross-functional" when the page is divided into different "lanes" describing the control of different organizational chart units. A symbol appearing in a particular "lane" is within the control of that organizational unit. This technique allows the analyst to locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision correctly, allowing the relationship between different organizational units with responsibility over a single process. Flowcharts are great business process improvement tools. Thats why classic flowchart software offen used as business process automation software for developing workflow and automate business processes.

**Standard Flowchart Symbols**

Flowcharts are the best for visually representation the business processes and the flow of a custom-order process through various departments within an organization.

Flowcharts use special shapes to represent different types of actions or steps in a process. Lines and arrows show the sequence of these steps, and the relationships between them.

## Workflow –°hart Symbols

Workflow relationships are where work is done by different departments in a fixed sequence. This means that one department needs to finish its job before work can continue in another department. The development and maintenance of these work flow relationships is very important for managers because they are dependant on the preceding areas for his or her own work, and responsible to managers and workers at different stages further down the chain. Workflow relationships development is reflected in the various regular workflow diagram documents and is critical for traing departments and have work done. Workflow diagram also used for passing standard sertifications to prepare workflow descriptions of job dependencies and work chains.

## Types of Structures Flowchart

Your flowcharts will look less subject to errors and much easier to understand when you use only a fixed set of structures:

| Structures | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Case | Typically has more than two possible situations. As an example may be used to decide which pizza to order for company of 5. |
| Loop | This type of flowcharts is based on multiple repeats of steps or actions. As an example the needed quantity of symbols for creating/entering a passwords. Program will not accept it until user won't enter minimum 7 symbols. |
| Decision (Conditional) | Known as "if","then" chain, used in flowcharts to process further according on decision. A very common in software development. As an example of decision structure flowchart could be a Voice Machine on your phone. If you don't pick a phone after 4 buzzers, voice machine will turn on. |
| Sequence | Commonly used as a step-by-step flowchart symbols guide, which makes flowchart look like a chain of actions used one after another. How to make cookies may be an example. This is because a recipe describes a process or sequence. |

## The Flowchart Symbols and Their Usage

**Process** represents a step in your process.

![Process Shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Process-shape.png)

**Predefined process** indicate a set of steps that combine to create a sub-process that is defined elsewhere, often on another page of the same drawing.

![Predefined process shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Predefined-process-shape.png)

**Decision** indicates a point where the outcome of a decision dictates the next step. There can be multiple outcomes, but often there are just two ‚Äî yes and no.

![Decision shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Decision-shape.png)

**Terminal point** indicates the starting and ending points of a process.

![terminator shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Terminator-shape.png)

**Data Shape** Indicates that information is coming into the process from outside, or leaving the process.

![stored data shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Stored-data-shape.png)

**Delay shape** Represents a waiting period where no activity is done. In Process Mapping, delays are often important as they may result in adding to the cost of the product or simply delaying its production.

![delay shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Delay-shape.png)

**Database shape** Use this shape for a step that results in information being stored.

![database shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Database-shape.png)

**Step** represents a single step within a process, and usually contains the name of a specific action.

**Page symbols** refer to individual web pages, which may or may not contain multiple elements.

**File symbols** represent those data elements that exist independently of navigational properties outside of that page, e.g., audio sounds, movie clips, or a portable document file (PDF).

A **decision point** indicates a sequence in the process at which the end user chooses an option, i.e., a "yes-no", or "true-false" response, and then branches to different parts of the flowchart.

**Arrows and connecting lines** diagram the logical progression through the course, subject to the choices made at decision or action points within the process.

The **input/action symbol** represents a user response that directs the course flow from that point onwards, i.e., an online test, or questionnaire form.

![manual input shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Manual-input-shape.png)

Represents the choice made by the user from mutually exclusive options, e.g., a student choosing among different lesson plans.

**Conditional selector** is similar to the conditional branch except that the user has the option to choose from a number of paths that will fulfill the requested conditions, e.g., the results of a search engine request.

Pages that share one or more common aspects, and are functionally identical may be simplified as a rounded corner rectangle, such as an on-line test or feedback form.

**Annotations** provide helpful comments or explanations, e.g. denoting the location where an undeveloped new page/process will fit into the navigational flow structure, or notes for specific team members for further development.

**Flow references and flow areas** are symbols for reusable sequences, such as logging in with a specific user id and password to enter the course or to initiate an on-line quiz. The flow reference symbol acts as a placeholder for the flow area sequence in the chart in every situation in which it is repeated.

Flow area is used as a flow area, it documents sections that share similar components/repeated steps within that flow, and requires the use of the following two symbols: entry and exit points.

**Exit point** concludes the subroutine, such as when the proper user id and password are verified, and documents where the user re-enters the master flowchart.

**Entry point** documents the place within the master flowchart where the process deviates into a subroutine.

**Reference** is used as a connecting point when the flowchart necessitates using more than one page, or refers to a complicated subroutine that would be impossible to contain on the main flowchart page.

**On-page reference** Indicates that the next or previous step is somewhere else on the flowchart. It is particularly useful for large flowcharts.

![On-page reference shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/On-page-reference-shape.png)

**Off-page reference** Use the a set of hyperlinks between two pages of a flowchart or between a sub-process shape and a separate flowchart page that shows the steps in that sub-process.

![Off-page reference shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Off-page-reference-shape.png)

**Flowchart Shapes** The designers can click this multi-shape to set to any of the following shapes: Data, Document, Decision, or Process. Any text you type onto the shape, or information you add to its Shape Data, remains with the shape.

![Flowchart Shapes](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Flowchart-shapes.png)

**Document** Represents a step that results in a document.

![Document shape](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/picture/Document-shape.png)

Creating flowcharts use special objects to express what is needed to be presented or explained. Find flowchart symbols meaning as well as specific ones which can be used in different fields of activity showing the workflows in auditing, accounting, selling processes (to show the interaction between customer and sales company or an internal sales process), human resource management (displaying recruitment, payroll systems, hiring process and company‚Äôs development) and many more kinds of business in ConceptDraw DIAGRAM as well as Process Map, Business Process, and Education Flowcharts Symbols. Visualize business and technical processes as well as software algorithms, your activities using various shapes connected with arrowed lines showing the process flow directions.
