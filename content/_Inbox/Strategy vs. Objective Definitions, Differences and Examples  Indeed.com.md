2.  Strategy vs. Objective: Definitions, Differences and Examples

The four necessary parts that make up any plan worth following are goals, objectives, strategies and tactics. Together, all four are vital for success, but how do they differ individually? A goal designates a broader outcome you are working toward. Tactics are what you use to get to that goal. But the middle two components, objectives and strategies, are the aspects necessary to meet business and career goals that people sometimes mix up.

In this article, we define strategy and objective, discuss the differences between these two concepts and offer examples of each that you can use in the workplace.

## What is a strategy?

A strategy is an overarching approach taken to meet or exceed your goals, and the actions taken must relate to the original goal set by management. For example, a marketing company’s strategy can be to increase the amount of written content on a company’s website; the execution of the strategy includes hiring writers to streamline the process.

A strategy can contain multiple elements like:

-   Company mission: A company’s mission is predicated on the company's purpose and aspirations. During this step, you’re finding out what you’re trying to accomplish when putting your product or service on the open market and how customers will benefit. Overall, the goal ascribed by management is included within the company’s mission statement and provides a roadmap in how you want to reach your goal.   
    
-   Core values: The execution of your strategy is guided by your [core values](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/core-values). In other words, they determine how you spend your time in making key decisions and the trajectory of your growth. In the workplace, you can use your core values to advance your career and determine which industry you want to work in—and set short- and long-term targets to help you get there. Some examples of core values include community, integrity, respect and responsibility.   
    
-   Results from a SWOT Analysis: A [SWOT analysis](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/swot-analysis-guide) is a comprehensive evaluation of all the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the strategy you compose. There are internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external (opportunities and threats) factors you need to consider when conducting a SWOT analysis to help evaluate what variables can and cannot be changed in your strategic planning.   
    
-   Defining a budget, finance and staffing needs: Your department should be asked to generate a budget that supports the organization’s effort in achieving its goals. This action is not limited to the finance department, but it may be reviewed by them upon submission to see if actions can be practically executed while meeting the budgetary requirements. 
    

## What is an objective? 

An objective is a measurable action taken to execute the strategy agreed on by management and the rest of the organization. An objective follows the paradigm of the [SMART](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/smart-goals) formula (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant and Time-based). Thus, a series of objectives must be assigned and completed in order to complete the strategy and meet the company’s primary goal. 

Let’s take a took at the SMART formula and how it can be used in pursuing an objective: 

-   Specific: This step details what you want to achieve. In fact, the formulation of your goals and strategy should meet the requirements of this step to proceed.  Double-check and ensure that this is the direction you want to go and whether the steps in the strategy can be easily understood. The more clarity you have, the more likely it is to produce successful results.   
    
-   Measurable: Stating your evidence is crucial in finding out how you’re measuring your goal. Setting up milestones can assist you in breaking down a timeline to reach the desired steps of your objectives.  If you’re applying for a job, you can use this step as a benchmark to see the number of positions you’ve applied to and amount of interviews you landed. You can plan and adjust in case you run into any disruptions and establish a rewards system when you reach a milestone, too.  
    
-   Achievable: Ensure that the objective is one you can achieve and is aligned with your strategy. Identifying your motivations in meeting your objectives helps you keep your focus on current tasks. Also, it can outline the effort and resources needed to achieve your objective and move onto the next one.   
    
-   Relevant: Make sure that the objectives are aligned with your core values and with your long-term aspirations. Rethink your objective if you continue to express doubts about it representing your core values.  
    
-   Time-based: Decide on the appropriate timeline to complete this objective and review if that pursuit is dependent on the completion of other objectives. You want to ensure that you can move forward after an objective’s conclusion. There are times where you’ll need to consider variables that may affect the timeline of certain tasks. 
    

## Strategy vs. objective: key differences

A strategy helps you create a plan for how you want to achieve a goal, whereas an objective is a list of documented steps that assist you in fulfilling the goals of the strategy. 

The differences between a strategy and an objective also include: 

-   Purpose: A strategy is meant to solve problems and determine a pathway towards a goal. An objective has measured elements that relate to the execution of the strategy and when it should be finalized.  
    
-   Execution: To build a strategy, you need to have an overview of your core values and the motivations for why you’re coming up with a strategy. Consistent motivation is the driver of diligence in the workplace. A robust strategy can maximize the output of a team if it fully buys into the mission of the organization. Preparing objectives occurs once you have a finalized set of core values and motivations. Objectives also assess how you’ll apply your core values and motivations to perform tasks and find out how you can improve in the process.
    

## Examples of a strategy and an objective

Here is an example of a strategy to increase a company’s client base and the objectives that follow:

### Strategy

A strategy is designed to measure a goal. For example, a goal may be for a company to increase the client base of Stevie’s Marketing from five clients to 10 by the end of the year.

To accomplish this goal, the company needs to do the following:

-   Increase the size of its sales staff.
    
-   Clean up the lead generation software and have management inspect for execution.
    
-   Schedule proposal meetings and dates for the [sales manager](https://www.indeed.com/q-sales-manager-jobs.html?from=careerguide-autohyperlink-en-US) to close sales.
    
-   Hold weekly meetings on progress.
    

### Objectives

Here are objectives that can lead to the success of the strategy:

-   Human resources will hire five new members of the sales team by the end of September.  
    
-   Three members of the sales team will work on inserting the right data into the lead generation software and complete it by the end of November.  
    
-   The sales manager will be on proposal calls in order to secure five in-person meetings with prospects by Thanksgiving and will meet with the prospects to close five deals to bring them onboard.  
    
-   Sales team meetings are held on Monday afternoon to report on the progress of these meetings. Jan from human resources will take notes on progress and action items for the team to work on during the week. The CEO is continually monitoring the progress to ensure the completion of all objectives by the end of the year.
