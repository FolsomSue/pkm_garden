# Specified View
- Business Unity Taxonomy
- Issue: shared components between related business units, some *not shared* even within the business unit
	- E.g.
		- Gas Distribution vs. Transmission vs. Both
		- Electric Distribution vs. Transmission vs. Both
		- Common to Gas and Electric
		- N60
- Current vs. Future State
	- Supposedly modelling via Plateaus, with Gaps separating them
		- With Gaps fulfilled by projects
	- Need to figure out how this concept will work at the specified level
	- Plateaus are meant to identify gaps, deliverables (business plans, roadmaps, eg.), projects, programs, work packages...
		- Not necessarily for underlying capabilities, services, components
- Integrations
	- Need to model Data Objects, information flows
	- Need to model Integration approaches
		- I'm abstracting these as Integration Services (WIP)
- Capabilities
	- The Business Capabilities for Gas / Electric are very incomplete and out of date
	- Shoot for L3 from the BCM (L1, L2 not too useful)
	- How to do 
- Perspectives / Themes
	- E.g. CX
	- -> Use a relationship to a Value Stream!!!
	- Components *realize* a value stream
	- Other business elements *serve* a value stream
- NFRs
	- Do we model these as attributes? Or relations -- and to what?
- Model as relations:
	- App owners?
	- App users?
	- App / Org managed?
	- GCA view is needed, driven by app owners (who pay for it)
-  Landscape
	- Revamping approach re BU hierarchy
		- Removing attributes, replacing with relationships
	- Revamping approach to "Types, Themes"
		- Replacing attributes with relations to value streams
	- Modifying integrations to reflect "real" relationships, directions
	- Figuring out Plateaus to permit legacy / current / transitional / to-be states
		- And how to incorporate as-builts (when we get those)
